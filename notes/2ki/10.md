## 2KI 10:31

Even though Jehu was an instrument of God's judgement on King Ahab, he killed many other unnecessary people like King Ahaziah.

It seems he was more motivated by politics rather than actually serving the Lord. Although God commended him for executing God's judgement, he was rebuked by the prophet Hosea
