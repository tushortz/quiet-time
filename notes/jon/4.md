## JON 4:11

Jonah did not perform miracles but there unbelieving Nations of Nineveh relented at the preaching of Nineveh.

The people of Israel saw Jesus perform many mighty miracles but did not repent. Jonah was a mere prophet. Jesus is the son of God.

Inspite of these, they did not repent so their judgement will be more severe
