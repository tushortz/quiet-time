## GEN 6:3

The Holy Spirit was trying to help man live right but man was given to lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and the pride of life.

God had to take away his spirit and man died a total spiritual death.

This may also refer to Adam the man God created as in the Hebrew. My spirit shall not always strive with Adam because he ALSO is flesh, then God gave him 120 more years to live

The Holy Spirit was again in connection to the spoken word of God here
