## LEV 10:9

I think Aaron?s sons may have been under the influence of alcohol when they went to offer fire to God. It may have impaired their ability to think properly. In this scenario, they were setting a bad example and if God had not intervened, the people would have thought it was normal.

**Related verses**: Leviticus 10:9. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3355961313859461781)
