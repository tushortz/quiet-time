## LEV 4:3

The high priest represented the whole congregations therefore for the anointed priest to sin was tantamount to the whole Israelites sinning.

Only the anointed priest and the whole congregation were told to sacrifice a bull.  The sacrifice was costly depending on the status of the sinner.

- bull for High priest/whole congregation 
- make goat for Civic leader
- female goat/lamb for ordinary Israelite 
- turtle dove/pigeon for the very poor 
- handful of fine flour for the too poor

For offerings of an animal, it had to be without blemish. So Jesus being the great high priest and atoning for our sins which was laid on him was the same as him bring the sinner and because he was the perfect sinless sacrifice without blemish, he was also the perfect sacrifice.
