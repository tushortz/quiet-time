## JOS 11:19

The Hivites living in Gibeon were wise in the sense that they made peace with Israel and were not destroyed.

The others however already knew God was giving Israel victory and still went on to wage war against them.

Be a man of peace. Rahab did similar, she made peace with the men of Israel and was not destroyed

## JOS 11:15

He did all that was commanded of him of Moses. There is also a ranking. From God to Moses and Moses then commanded Joshua.

Joshua speaks to our leaders who then delegates instructions. We should obey our leaders to the letter just as Joshua did and God will bless whatever he has sent us to do. Absolute obedience is needed
