## JOS 19:9

God blessed us so that we can be a blessing. The fact that we gave more then we can carry only explains that we should give out so there will be room for new things.

God specifically chose Simeon to have part of Judah since God decided the lot. Judah however didn't grumble. We need to learn certain lessons.


The tribe of praise got more than they can carry.
PRAISE open doors for abundant blessings. 

Those who HEAR and obey God are also entitled to a share of God's blessings
