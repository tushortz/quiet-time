## JAS 1:26

My tongue and the words of my mouth can be used to judge my faith.

I cannot claim to be a Christian and still use curse words.

## JAS 1:19

Quick to hear, slow speak.

Paying attention to God's words and being slow to speak so you don't say anything rash.

Even a fool is thought to be wise when he keeps his mouth shut.

Faith works by love. The victor?s crown is given to those who love Jesus. Love helps us to endure and persevere under trials

## JAS 1:4

One can be completely developed in one?s faith. Although endurance is needed. Endurance then only comes when our faith is tested and tried.

The testing and trials actually make us refined and perfectly developed in faith.
