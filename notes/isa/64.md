## ISA 64:6

It's impossible to attain righteousness by our good works. If it was so, how many good works must we do? How about other people who have sinned but not have the opportunity to start any good words whilst isolated in prison. They are damned.

If God's standard of righteousness is based on good works then who is the man  whose good works will be the dividing line between enough good works and not enough good works. Do not be deceived, our good works cannot save us. And our good works cannot be a standard for God because we are sinners and have fallen short of God's glory (Romans 3:23)

We have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus. (Ephesians 2:8-9) 

After we are saved by believing in Jesus then our good works counts as acceptable to God otherwise we are just campaigning after election.
