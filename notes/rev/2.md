## REV 2:5

Remembrance, repentance and doing the old works when we first met God is returning to the First Love.

Disobeying and not doing it is to lose your place and significance and the dream and purpose for which a God placed you where you were meant to be.

**Related verses**: REVELATION 2:5. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2996388279832273003)
