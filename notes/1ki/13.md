## 1KI 13:18

the prophet lied to the man of God than an angel had appeared to him to I form the man if God to go back and eat (thus contradicting the instructions that God gave the man of God).

no angel or man should be able to make me disobey the clear words given to me by God.

this was the same error that Adam and Eve committed after God has given a clear instruction. they ended up listening to another voice
