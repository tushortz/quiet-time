## 1KI 18:17

Ahah accusing Elijah of bringing disaster on Israel whereas the truth is Arab is a covenant breaker and has married a high-rank witch who has led Israel into idolatry.

Most times, the guilty are so blinded by their sin that they blame the innocents for their own problems and sins.

Rejecting the commandments of God will bring disaster especially if you are breaking his covenant.
