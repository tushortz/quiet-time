## 1CH 19:4

For lack of good advice, a war started. David had good intentions but evil advice on the part of the counsellor of Hanun the King and his actions led to loss of people's lives.

Cutting of the beard was a sign of mourning as well as ripping of the garment. He in a way mocked the Elders of Israel to show mock mourning but not just that, what was worse is that ripping a garment to the hip was usually a demeaning act done to prisoners of war because their buttocks would be exposed if not their pants
