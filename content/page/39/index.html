            JHN 2:2 Jesus already had disciples when he was invited to the wedding in Cana where he turned the water used for cleansing to wine for drinking and pleasure.
Imagine trying to use water to wash and find wine and you put some in your mouth and it tastes even nicer.
God provided more than enough. Had Jesus not been invited, there would have been shortage of wine.
It looks like it was a great feast and feasts usually lasts 7 days.
