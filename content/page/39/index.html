Related verses: Matthew 15:31. See notes

        <p>
            EXO 34:29 The reason his skin glowed was because he had been with God for forty days and forty night. The presence of God had permeated him so much that he became a different person.
That was the glory of God. the same happened when Peter, James and John saw Jesus glory on the mount of transfiguration when his face and cloth shone brighter than the sun

            EXO 32:11 Moses understood the heart of God. I don&rsquo;t think God really wanted to destroy them. that would have been the last resort because my God is full of mercy and compassion.
Moses reversed the word. Whereas God had initially said to Moses, YOUR PEOPLE, Moses now interceded telling God that this is YOUR PEOPLE whom you brought out of Egypt

            EXO 30:32 The Holy anointing oil is sacred and must neither be poured on a layman nor made in the same composition because the anointing oil is sacred and represents the Holy spirit. there is nothing else in comparison with the Holy Spirit.
It must only be poured in those chosen to be anointed by God

spirits enter through the holes of your body. Shield yourself from the bad and expose yourself to the evil
Related verses: Romans 10:17. See notes
ROM 10:16 People cannot understand the truth let alone believe it because their minds had been blinded by a veil caused by Satan. The veil can only be removed when we believe in Jesus.

        <p>
            EXO 28:5 The garments was there to enable them to serve as priests. Also the garment was for beautification and honour amongst other people.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EXO 17:11 Moses raising up his hands was a sign of appeal to God for help and enablement (NASB study Bible). The outcome of the battle was spiritually decided. If Amalek knew this, they would just focus on killing Moses rather than fighting any battle.
As long as Moses hands were lifted up, the battle was won. As long as my hands are lifted up to God for help, he will help and save me because my hands is short and can become fatigued but his hands is not short that it cannot save neither can God be fatigued
