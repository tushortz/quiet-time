            1CO 9:27 Be careful with your body and its desires. You are not a superman. You are still a man living in a corrupt body. Renew your mind with the word of God constantly and forget about your desires otherwise you will be brought down.
Forget about your feelings. Focus on the work of God. The time is short.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EXO 4:4 God was sending Moses to the Israelites but not without signs and wonders. He empowered Moses to do the undoable.
Moses ran away from the staff turned snake but God told him to take the snake by the tail. &lsquo;Who does that&rsquo;. God was directly telling him to confront his fears. God was saying &lsquo;i make the harmless deadly and the deadly harmless.
Second empowerment was turning a healthy hand to a diseased one and a diseased one to a healthy flesh.

        <p>
            EXO 25:9 God was specific about the design. God is always specific in his word and that&rsquo;s why we are to fully obey him by paying attention to his word. Partial obedience is still disobedience.
Related verses: Sh&rsquo;mot (Exo) 25:9. See notes
EXO 25:8 THEY will make for GOD a sanctuary where he will dwell. Just as we are to offer our body a living sacrifice and it is a temple of the Holy Ghost but it needs to be according to God&rsquo;s word and specification

        <p>
            EXO 24:12 God gave Moses the task to teach what has been written by God.
In the New Testament, we would deem him a great Apostle :), Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.
Moses was a Priest and Prophet. He operated in 6 different offices

EXO 24:1 The 70 elders of Israel were the 70 descendants of Jacob who came with him or was already in Egypt.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EXO 23:29 God is also considerate of nature irrespective of his spiritual capabilities. Strategic planning is involved here as driving out the Canaanites, Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites, Amorites etc would cause the multiplication of wild animals.
These group of people are also needed to play their role so that the Israelites would in turn enjoy the fruit of their (not Israeli&rsquo;s) labour.

EXO 23:25 He and I signifying there are two entities involved in this speech.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EXO 13:17 God would not take the Israelites through shortcuts because they were not able to prove their preparation for warfare otherwise they would return back to Egypt, the land of son and bondage. Instead he take them through roundabouts, even though it was long, it was to prepare them carefully for the future and the promises ahead.
They had to be trained and tested so that they can be purified and fit for the promise land

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            GEN 46:4 Faith Even though Jacob knew his families were going to suffer in Egypt for 400+ years, he still obeyed God. Even though he didn&rsquo;t live to witness those years of suffering nor did he get the inheritance in his lifetime, he still proceeded into Egypt with his family.
Sometimes, it is God&rsquo;s will that we go through a very difficult time in our life. God has his plan and his reward but are we willing to trust him even though we don&rsquo;t see the big picture or do we want to do it our own way and bear the consequences.

        <p>
            GEN 44:33 Repentance What a transformation. The Judah that was behind selling Joseph as a slave in times past was now willing to be in place of Benjamin as a servant of Joseph. Great sign of repentance. The brothers of Joseph had come to realise that they acted foolishly are now regretting their past actions
When you repent, it shows in your actions and words
