            EZR 4:15 What you do now determines your future. The Samaritans had to use the past against the people of Judah to alter them from building the temple and the wall of Jerusalem.
The devil uses this same tactics to stop you or put a roadblock to your walk with God. Thank God our lovely God don&rsquo;t count our past sins against us.
If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand - Psalms 130:3

            2KI 18:30 The messengers of the king of Assyria recounted their victories to instil fear in the men of Judah.
David recounted his past testimonies until he won the victory over Goliath. - 1 Samuel 17:37
They overcame the devil by the blood of the lamb and THE WORD OF THEIR TESTIMONY - Revelation 12:11
Our testimony makes us overcomers.

            2KI 14:27 If the Lord had said it, Israel would have been wiped out like the Amalekites
Related verses: 2 KINGS 14:27. See notes
2KI 14:9 Amaziah king of Judah is the thorn bush, Joash king of Israel is the tall cedar of Lebanon.

        <p>
            2KI 13:21 Elisha was so anointed that his dead bones still retained the anointing to raise the dead. Elisha was very sick probably because of old age.
He had witness a minimum of 63 years of about 6 different kings reign.
There was no one who the double potion of the anointing or more was passed on. Gehazi could have been the one to inherit the strong anointing. This anointing made Elijah and Elisha relate with Kings.

        <p>
            2KI 10:31 Even though Jehu was an instrument of God&rsquo;s judgement on King Ahab, he killed many other unnecessary people like King Ahaziah.
It seems he was more motivated by politics rather than actually serving the Lord. Although God commended him for executing God&rsquo;s judgement, he was rebuked by the prophet Hosea
