Do not let Hezekiah deceive you &hellip; (in chapter 36) Do not let your God deceive you

        <p>
            ISA 26:3 There is peace and there is perfect peace. This can only be given by the prince of peace.
Thesaurus defines peace as freedom of the mind from annoyance, distraction, anxiety, obsession etc.
We can only achieve perfect peace when our mind is focused on Jesus and not of the things of the world. There is always tribulation in the world. We live in a fast paced world that tries us out but focusing on Jesus helps us to discard unnecessary problems that can occur with a mind focused on the world, its fleeting pleasures, fame and glory.
