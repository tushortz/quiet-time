            LUK 19:26 God has given me a gift but I have disregarded it. I need to work harder because of the day fo accountability. If I want it to be increased I have to step out in faith and ignore my reputation and what people say about me. In the end I am only working for God and the fear of man will put me in a snare

I must not be jealous because others are treated better than me. We all have different walk with God but he chooses whom he favours.

I must not take my gaze away from Christ. The apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3
