        <p>
            1KI 4:15 The name sounds Egyptian. she&rsquo;s probably the daughter of the Egyptian woman he married.
Basemath doesn&rsquo;t sound like an Israeli name. it may be possible, another daughter of Solomon&rsquo;s foreign wives

        <p>
            2CH 9:27 Another thing to note in Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom is not just in building but in transportation. he controlled nations through control of the trade routes. that way riches reached Israel

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">GEN 19</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            GEN 19:3 A sign of the communion. they had communion before judgement. Jesus had communion before he faced judgement on the cross. The Israelites had communion before judgement fell on Egypt.
The communion and the unleavened bread was to show that there is no sin in me and the wine is a sign of purity. After you crush me, you will find no dreggs in me.
But Jesus had to drink of the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath and taste the dreggs.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">EZK 22</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EZK 22:4 God&rsquo;s judgement was because of idolatry and bloodshed. A direct desecration of the golden rule. To love God and others.
Sodom and Gomorrah was involved in this. Homosexuality was a common practise in Sodom and Gomorrah. Male temple prostitutes also engaged in homosexual acts in pagan religion.
Before God judges the earth, there had to be an outcry by humans bringing into account the deeds of the offenders.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LEV 16:13 the purpose of the incense and the fire was to create a cloud of smoke which would then cover the mercy seat so that the high priest would not come into direct eye contact with God when he sprinkles the blood on the mercy seat. this is because the glory of God will be manifested
Related verses: Leviticus 16:2, Leviticus 16:13. See notes
LEV 16:15 The High priest was to offer two sacrifices on the day of atonement.
