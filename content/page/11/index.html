            1KI 12:7 Leadership starts with humility and servanthood. Rehoboam listened to the wrong advice and lost most of the kingdom.

Related verses: 1 Kings 12:7. See notes
1KI 12:27 Doubt can rob us of God&rsquo;s promises. Even though God had elevated Jeroboam and have made him king of Israel and made a covenant to obey God, he decided to make the Israelites serve calves as they did before in the wilderness after they went away from Egypt.
