            1SA 5:7 God would not be manipulated to act on my behalf especially when I am living a sinful lifestyle. neither would God share his glory with any other. The ark of God was placed before Dagon to show Dagon&rsquo;s superiority but God struck Dagon and he fell before the ark thus God was showing his superiority.
God also struck the Philistine cities with plagues as he did in Egypt. he first struck their gods then their 5 lords, then the people.

            JHN 1:3  The word of a person are what we hear as they speak, the sound that comes from their mouth as they speak.

JHN 1:32 The baptism was a way to identify Jesus as the messiah. Whoever the Holy Spirit falls and remains upon was the sign to be used to identify the messiah.
