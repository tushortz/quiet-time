        <p>
            JOB 22:30 lol it&rsquo;s actually funny that this was exactly what happened to Eliphaz. God told Job to pray for his three friends after they had misrepresented God and said false statements about Job&rsquo;s integrity
Related verses: Job 22:30. See notes
JOB 22:5 False accusations. we can&rsquo;t judge by circumstances the Integrity of a person.
in ancient times blessings is directly associated with righteous and the devil tries to break this bond by imploring God to do that in the life of Job.

        <p>
            1JN 4:19 Without God my love is selfish because the true source of love is God.
Lucifer tried to do things without God but realised he couldn&rsquo;t love without him. True love emanates with intimacy with God who alone is love.
Lord help me to have your heart. A heart that unselfishly seeks the best for everyone.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            PSA 91:1 The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me.
I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that&rsquo;s another level.
Jesus already promised he&rsquo;s with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.

Related verses: 2 CORINTHIANS 3:14. See notes
2CO 3:14 People cannot understand the truth let alone believe it because their minds had been blinded by a veil caused by Satan. The veil can only be removed when we believe in Jesus.
This is why evangelists and preachers are needed

            GEN 28:22 A tithe is a sign of dependence on God. The stone as a pillar was a memorial of covenant between Jacob and God.

I must not be jealous because others are treated better than me. We all have different walk with God but he chooses whom he favours.
