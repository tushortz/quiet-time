        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JHN 13:18 I believe this Psalm was written when he fled from his son Absalom. His trusted friend and counsellor &ldquo;Ahithophel&rdquo; had connived with Absalom in his rebellion. Ahithophel&rsquo;s motive may have been because David slept with his grand daughter &ldquo;BathSheba&rdquo; and had his son&rsquo;s son-in-law Uriah killed in battle.
In those days, Ahithophel&rsquo;s counsel was such that it was likened to when one inquired at the oracles of God (2 Samuel 16:23).

        <p>
            2TI 2:1 Be strong in the Lord. Not in the gym, or physics, fighting, sports or in PhD. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. Being strong in education or gym is good but the main aim is to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
You must know God before you can be strong in the Lord.
Example, if you don&rsquo;t know about the country&rsquo;s system e.g. Free education till certain level in some countries, you would be at loss.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            REV 18:3 Babylon was once great
(Babylon was handsome, he had 6 packs, he was built. He had muscles But he fell and is now the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birds.)
If you have multiple sexual partners, you will become the habitation of Devils.
When you have sexual demons enter you, you become disobedient, licentious, rebellious.
Related verses: Revelation 18:2-5. See notes

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            ISA 64:6 It&rsquo;s impossible to attain righteousness by our good works. If it was so, how many good works must we do? How about other people who have sinned but not have the opportunity to start any good words whilst isolated in prison. They are damned.
If God&rsquo;s standard of righteousness is based on good works then who is the man whose good works will be the dividing line between enough good works and not enough good works.
