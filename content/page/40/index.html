        <p>
            LEV 10:9 I think Aaron?s sons may have been under the influence of alcohol when they went to offer fire to God. It may have impaired their ability to think properly. In this scenario, they were setting a bad example and if God had not intervened, the people would have thought it was normal.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LEV 8:17 The sin offering was always to be burned because it signified impurity. It had to be burned so that none would remain thereby an example of sinlessness and perfect purity

        <p>
            LUK 6:19 This wasn?t even Jesus trying to pray for them. It is power coming from him and healing them as they tried to touch him
Related verses: Luke 6:19. See notes
LUK 6:7 There is usually a stronghold present when someone is filled with dos and donts. It?s usually a sign of bondage and oppression. Lack of the Holy Spirit .
On the other hand a lack of self control is also a sign of the presence of demons.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LUK 5:33 That was an indirect insult to Jesus that he didn?t teach his disciples well and also since he was an irresponsible party goer it was clear that his disciples would be the same as well as his circles of sinners
Related verses: Luke 5:33. See notes
LUK 5:30 The good thing is that Jesus was thinking and not just blinded by religious dos and don?t. Unfortunately many Christians stopped using their brains when it comes to the issue of faith.

            LUK 1:77 To be a teacher and a preacher of God?s means of salvation through forgiveness of sins. I am also commissioned to do the same except with powers and backed by the Holy Spirit as much as John and Jesus. I cannot do this without him

        <p>
            MRK 15:38 On the sabbath there was no buying and selling and work so Jesus had to die earlier otherwise his body would not be buried and although the death of the crucified usually lasted about 2 to 3 days, Jesus died just six hours after being crucified because he willingly released his spirit. Because there was only three hours left, Jesus was buried before the sabbath started.
There was no time to embalm him and Jews didn?

When I realise how much I?ve been forgiven, it will help me love God even more.
