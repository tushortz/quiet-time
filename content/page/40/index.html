        <p>
            JOB 36:14 Some of the cult prostitutes were homosexuals. it was seen as a fertility rite and oh my goodness, what a terrible atrocity.
I believe this is the same practice in Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim.
I believe they indulged in idol worship which permitted them to indulge in homosexuality and that became the culture of the city.
unfortunately this is where all false religion ends up people in.
