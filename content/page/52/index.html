            1CH 13:10 God had commanded in Exodus 25:12-15 that the ark should be carried on poles through the four rings. The instruction was followed by the Israelites during the times of Moses and Aaron up until the Philistines captured it.
The Philistines did send it back on cows because they didn?t know better but they at least showed respect and God honoured it by allowing their guess [if the oxen went towards the land of Israel] to come to pass to show that it was him (God) who struck the Philistines with tumours.

Who can stand against the Lord of Host. Not even the devil or any witch, wizard, demon or occultist power can withstand such mighty force from the Lord.

            1CH 7:24 Even though Beriah?s name means (on misfortune), he bore a daughter who made a good name. We?ve always read about men building cities but this lady whose name was Sheerah made a name for herself.
The fact that you had a past shouldn?t determine your future. She could have decided that since my father?s name means misfortune, then I would continue to live unfortunate by doing nothing. But no, that didn?
