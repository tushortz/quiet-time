        <p>
            LEV 14:36 The house must be emptied before the priest comes in otherwise they will all be declared unclean. This means that as long as the priest has not entered, there is still grace to save some. The priest represented God to the people and because he carried the anointing, the anointing has not entered the unclean house

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JHN 2:2 Jesus already had disciples when he was invited to the wedding in Cana where he turned the water used for cleansing to wine for drinking and pleasure.
Imagine trying to use water to wash and find wine and you put some in your mouth and it tastes even nicer.
God provided more than enough. Had Jesus not been invited, there would have been shortage of wine.
It looks like it was a great feast and feasts usually lasts 7 days.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LEV 10:9 I think Aaron?s sons may have been under the influence of alcohol when they went to offer fire to God. It may have impaired their ability to think properly. In this scenario, they were setting a bad example and if God had not intervened, the people would have thought it was normal.

            LEV 8:17 The sin offering was always to be burned because it signified impurity. It had to be burned so that none would remain thereby an example of sinlessness and perfect purity

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LUK 6:19 This wasn?t even Jesus trying to pray for them. It is power coming from him and healing them as they tried to touch him
Related verses: Luke 6:19. See notes
LUK 6:7 There is usually a stronghold present when someone is filled with dos and donts. It?s usually a sign of bondage and oppression. Lack of the Holy Spirit .
On the other hand a lack of self control is also a sign of the presence of demons.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LUK 5:33 That was an indirect insult to Jesus that he didn?t teach his disciples well and also since he was an irresponsible party goer it was clear that his disciples would be the same as well as his circles of sinners
Related verses: Luke 5:33. See notes
LUK 5:30 The good thing is that Jesus was thinking and not just blinded by religious dos and don?t. Unfortunately many Christians stopped using their brains when it comes to the issue of faith.

            LUK 1:77 To be a teacher and a preacher of God?s means of salvation through forgiveness of sins. I am also commissioned to do the same except with powers and backed by the Holy Spirit as much as John and Jesus. I cannot do this without him

        <p>
            MRK 15:38 On the sabbath there was no buying and selling and work so Jesus had to die earlier otherwise his body would not be buried and although the death of the crucified usually lasted about 2 to 3 days, Jesus died just six hours after being crucified because he willingly released his spirit. Because there was only three hours left, Jesus was buried before the sabbath started.
There was no time to embalm him and Jews didn?

            MRK 14:16 When I obey my leader, I will find it as he has said. It makes my life easy
Related verses: Mark 14:16. See notes
MRK 14:8 Either Mary Magdalene knew what she was doing or was moved by the Holy Spirit to do it but Jesus knew it was something that needed to be done.
She spent almost a year worth of wages to purchase the perfume. That probably was her savings.
