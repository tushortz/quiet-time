            JOS 5:9 Named after the new generations were circumcised removing the foreskin of their private part. A removal of the old and an appearance of the new.

Removing the old self and putting on a new self. Old things have passed away. All things become new.
Circumcision also means: May it be done to you as this foreskin (cut off from the rest) if you do not obey the commandments of God
