Related verses: Job 42:12. See notes
JOB 42:8 Job&rsquo;s friend Eliphaz wasn&rsquo;t present when God spoke to Job. I believe none of Job&rsquo;s other friends were around because God told Eliphaz to go to Job with 7 bulls and 7 rams so he could act as priest on their behalf

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">JOB 36</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 36:14 Some of the cult prostitutes were homosexuals. it was seen as a fertility rite and oh my goodness, what a terrible atrocity.
I believe this is the same practice in Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim.
I believe they indulged in idol worship which permitted them to indulge in homosexuality and that became the culture of the city.
unfortunately this is where all false religion ends up people in.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">JOB 23</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 23:10 Job is confident he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to deserve anything he was facing due to the understanding of his time that blessings is directly proportional to godliness (which is actually true in the long run).
Job is now experienced to know that in the short run that isn&rsquo;t necessarily always true yet his friends accuse him of wickedness.
Job thinks when God has tried him, he will be found innocent of the punishment he&rsquo;s facing due to his sin.
