            2SA 20:10 Joab is a bloody man. He killed another innocent man (his cousin Amasa) because he had been replaced by him as commander of the army.
Lord have mercy. i must be careful not to become bitter when replaced. I need to work on my personality and character

2SA 19:21 I don&rsquo;t think the children of Zeruiah was trained properly. Joab is worse, Abishai was always ready to kill anyone. Asahel died because he didn&rsquo;t listen to Abner and Abner had to kill him to save himself

            2SA 18:25 Basically if a man is running alone when bringing news of war then he has good news to tell and vice-versa
Related verses: 2 Samuel 18:25. See notes
2SA 18:22 In war, there was usually a runner who comes back home to bring the news of the outcome. Depending on the way the runner ran, people could detect of it was good or bad news.
This was the similar techniques used to explain the gospel in Isaiah 52:7.

            2SA 17:25 The key to understanding the family relationship here is that Amasa was the son of Ithra and Abigail (David&rsquo;s sister and daughter of Nahash (Ithra). it is likely Jesse married her mother after the death of her father)
Abigail was the half-sister of David and also a sister to Zeruiah (the mother of Joab, Asahel and Abishai)

        <p>
            2SA 14:30 This just explains the character of Absalom. Joan was trying to help him by bringing him back from exile. He was meant to be the next King as the oldest son alive. Because Joab would not come to him, he went and set his field on fire.
I believe it was one of the reason Joab killed him during the war to also revenge his field being set on fire.
