Related verses: 2 Samuel 19:28. See notes
2SA 19:21 I don&rsquo;t think the children of Zeruiah was trained properly. Joab is worse, Abishai was always ready to kill anyone. Asahel died because he didn&rsquo;t listen to Abner and Abner had to kill him to save himself

Related verses: 2 Samuel 18:25. See notes
2SA 18:22 In war, there was usually a runner who comes back home to bring the news of the outcome. Depending on the way the runner ran, people could detect of it was good or bad news.
This was the similar techniques used to explain the gospel in Isaiah 52:7.

            2SA 17:25 The key to understanding the family relationship here is that Amasa was the son of Ithra and Abigail (David&rsquo;s sister and daughter of Nahash (Ithra). it is likely Jesse married her mother after the death of her father)
Abigail was the half-sister of David and also a sister to Zeruiah (the mother of Joab, Asahel and Abishai)
