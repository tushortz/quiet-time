2SA 15:36 Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar
Related verses: 2 Samuel 15:36. See notes
2SA 15:34 Ushai was sent to disrupt the wisdom of Ahithophel who was very wise.
Related verses: 2 Samuel 15:34. See notes
2SA 15:31 David&rsquo;s words were still active even after all the problems going on. God had forgiven him. Although since the event of Bathsheba up until now, we didn&rsquo;t hear any thing about David enquiring of the Lord.

        <p>
            2SA 14:30 This just explains the character of Absalom. Joan was trying to help him by bringing him back from exile. He was meant to be the next King as the oldest son alive. Because Joab would not come to him, he went and set his field on fire.
I believe it was one of the reason Joab killed him during the war to also revenge his field being set on fire.

        <p>
            2SA 13:13 By raping Tamar, Amnon forfeited his chance to become the next King in Israel. He also forfeited his life and caused Tamar to be disgraced because she would no longer be given in marriage since she had lost her virginity, the sign of her pride as a woman.
Normally Amnon should be executed according to the law but because David did not take any action, Absalom took the law in his hands.

Related verses: 2 Samuel 12:24. See notes
2SA 12:13 David instant repentance led to forgiveness. It looks like God always give one chance before judgement as in the case of:
 Adam but he blamed his wife Eve but she blamed the serpent Cain but he lied Saul but he blamed the people David but he instantly repented  Related verses: 2 Samuel 12:13.

        <p>
            PSA 51:16 It&rsquo;s not about burnt offering and sacrifice but a sorrowful and repentant heart that is truly sorry for sins. Without that burnt offering and sacrifices will not be accepted
Related verses: Psalms 51:16-17. See notes
PSA 51:7 Hyssop was dipped in blood and sprinkled as in Exodus 12:22 and Leviticus 14:49
David understood that only blood could purify him from his sins, a type and shadow of the blood of Jesus shed on the cross

            2SA 10:3 For lack of good advice, a war started. David had good intentions but evil advice on the part of the counsellor of Hanun the King and his actions led to loss of people&rsquo;s lives.
Cutting of the beard was a sign of mourning as well as ripping of the garment. He in a way mocked the Elders of Israel to show mock mourning but not just that, what was worse is that ripping a garment to the hip was usually a demeaning act done to prisoners of war because their buttocks would be exposed if not their pants

        <p>
            2SA 8:16 This Jehoshaphat is not to be confused with the other King in later times after David.
Josh attained his position as the commander over the army because he attacked the Jebusites first when David wanted to war with Jebus and they were preventing and taunting him.
