        <p>
            MRK 7:7 The scriptures carry more weight and references than any tradition that could ever be. Unfortunately, one problem plaguing Christianity is giving it man-made traditions equal value to the scriptures or even more value. This can be seen in a lot of Christian sects. This nullify the word of God and renders it less-effective

Jesus was a carpenter and it was only possible to have performed his miracles through God.
