        <p>
            ISA 58:5 Fasting is a means of humbling myself. It should also be a time to mourn for my sins and produce a repentant heart (poor in Spirit)

Fasting makes my voice heard. Fasting is not just about depriving the body of food even though it&rsquo;s a means of starving the flesh to stuff the Spirit.
