        <p>
            2CH 6:33 The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.
Jews should face
 the temple when in Jerusalem Jerusalem when outside Canaan  Gentiles
 need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple  Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.
Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :).

        <p>
            DEU 8:3 The manna ceased but the law lasted forever. Man cannot live forever by eating bread or manna but man will have everlasting life if he abides by the word of God.
both manna and the commandments were given by God yet one was more important than the other.
The commandments lasted generations but the manna didn&rsquo;t even though both were provided by God. it goes to show that the spiritual is greater than the natural.

        <p>
            2CH 5:10 The jar of manna and Aaron&rsquo;s budded rod had probably been lost because they were both kept in the ark of the covenant along with the two stone tablets that had the 10 commandments written on it.
It shows that Aaron&rsquo;s rod was not meant to last forever neither was the manna but the commandments of God was to last for eternity.
Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod was for a sign, the manna was for a sign and also for temporary sustenance but the law was everlasting.

            1KI 7:14 Hiram was filled with the spirit of wisdom, understanding and skill so he was eligible to build the temple of God. It is worth noting that the writer of Chronicles found it worthy to mention that he had a maternal connection with the Israelites

            2CH 3:1 God also told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on the mountain of Moriah. I wouldn?t be surprised if it was exactly this location that God sent Abraham to perform the sacrifcie.
I checked the NASB Study Bible and it says it was the same spot
