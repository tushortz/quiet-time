 his hands were nailed to the cross his side were pierced (where his heart is located) his feets were pierced  Related verses: Proverbs 6:16-19.

Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it.
