        <p>
            2KI 3:27 One of the reasons God forbid the ways of the heathen. Child sacrifice was part of it and they sacrificed these to demons.
God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac long ago, it may have been a common practice in the time of Abraham but Abraham was willing to do so not to a demon but to the true God because Hebrews 11 tells us that ABRAHAM BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD.

        <p>
            2KI 1:3 It was a disgrace to leave the king of kings and go enquiry from demons from a different nation. Getting himself ensnared and bringing upon himself punishment as God had previously warned not to have anything to do with the gods of other nations.
It is so sad many Christians of nowadays are in the same bondage and finds nothing wrong with them. In fact the occult has been so blended in daily lives that we see nothing wrong in it.

            1KI 22:14 Will you speak to please the people or will you speak what God has told you even though it&rsquo;s bad news and 400 prophets are saying otherwise?
Related verses: 1 KINGS 22:13-14. See notes
1KI 22:5 It is always wise to involve God first in your decisions. He knows the best and helped king David a lot of times because David enquirer of him

        <p>
            1KI 21:20 Ahab regards Elijah the prophet of God as his enemy because Ahab has sold himself to do evil. Inspite of God&rsquo;s mercy on Ahab, he still did not repent. Ahab does have a heart but his wife&rsquo;s continual influence on him made him the monster of a king
Related verses: 1 KINGS 21:20. See notes
1KI 21:25 Repentance averts God&rsquo;s judgement even when it had been spoken. Although it may affect future generations until they decide to avert the judgement completely.

            1KI 20:39 The prophet represented Ahab, the man to be guarded was Ben-Hadad and the man who brought the man to be guarded was God.
God had delivered Ben-Hadad into the hands of Ahab to be devoted for destruction but Ahab made a pact with him and let him escape and Ahab unknowingly pronounced judgement on himself just as David had done when God also sent a prophet to him.

            1KI 18:17 Ahah accusing Elijah of bringing disaster on Israel whereas the truth is Arab is a covenant breaker and has married a high-rank witch who has led Israel into idolatry.
Most times, the guilty are so blinded by their sin that they blame the innocents for their own problems and sins.
