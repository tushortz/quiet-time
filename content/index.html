        <p>
            JER 19:5 The valley of Ben Hinnom was used to burn innocent children as sacrifices to Baal. God told Abraham to sacrifice his son as well on one of the mountains of Moriah long ago.
I think it wouldn&rsquo;t have been more difficult for Abraham if he had many children but because it was the only son of his old age, it was more difficult to do

        <p>
            JER 45:5 God was going to destroy Jerusalem soon through Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and God was saving Baruch the stress of acquiring things that would soon be destroyed.
Because Baruch had been a faithful friend and scribe for Jeremiah, God was repaying him his good deeds by sparing his life.
It pays to be good.

God is righteous and if he would not forgive, then it was just of him

JER 25:11 This is where Daniel got his revelation about when they would be free from exile (70 years)
