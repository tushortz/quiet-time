## EZK 22:4

God's judgement was because of idolatry and bloodshed. A direct desecration of the golden rule. To love God and others.

Sodom and Gomorrah was involved in this. Homosexuality was a common practise in Sodom and Gomorrah. Male temple prostitutes also engaged in homosexual acts in pagan religion.

Before God judges the earth, there had to be an outcry by humans bringing into account the deeds of the offenders.

The blood of Abel cried in revenge to Cain's murdering. The outcry of Sodom went up to heaven so God had to come down to do judgement.

The outcry of the Israelites was great in Egypt so God had to come down.

God raises a preacher to warn people of their evil deeds before he administers justice and judgement. Examples are Noah, Jonah, Jesus.

the reason why we have many preachers in this world of today is because the sins of the world is so great and there will be a great judgement coming soon.

more preachers is a sign of increase in sin but he will rescue the righteous
