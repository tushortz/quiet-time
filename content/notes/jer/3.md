## JER 3:15

The shepherds are the priests whose role is to teach the people the ways of God because Israel and Judah had backslidden to the point where the covenant curses began to operate in the nation.

Israel was taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 BC and after 136 years, Babylon destroyed Judah
