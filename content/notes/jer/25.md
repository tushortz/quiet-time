## JER 25:18

They were most guilty because they had more light and were closer to God than the gentile nations and even though God sent many prophets to them, they did not listen and rather killed some of them.

They continued in idolatry and shedding innocent blood.

Idolatry is a sign of lack of faith in God as the provider, sustainer, protector and guide of a person so they outsource the service of demons to do the thing God himself is meant to do thereby robbing him of his glory and honour.

Shedding of innocent blood is taking the place of God and misusing God's authority. The king is meant to take righteous decisions acting as a representative of God on earth but when a righteous person use killed or judgement is perverted, it hands over authority to the devil but God wants his kingdom setup on earth because he is the rightful owner of the world.
