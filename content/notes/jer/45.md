## JER 45:5

God was going to destroy Jerusalem soon through Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and God was saving Baruch the stress of acquiring things that would soon be destroyed.

Because Baruch had been a faithful friend and scribe for Jeremiah, God was repaying him his good deeds by sparing his life.

It pays to be good.
