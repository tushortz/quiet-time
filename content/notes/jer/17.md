## JER 17:5

By the arm of flesh shall no man prevail. Assyrian was conquering nations and as small nations were taking cover for protection in Egypt under Pharaoh Shabako, Israel was also tempted to do the same and God was warning them but they didn't listen and neither did they want to repent of idolatry.

## JER 17:5

Relying on man and his word at the expense of Gods words will bring disaster. The people despised God's word in favour of the words of false Prophets saying that Jerusalem will not be captured. It took 23 years before the words of Jeremiah was fulfilled. By this time a large amount of people had become his enemies because all he could for tell was doom to Jerusalem
