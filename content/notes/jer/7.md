## JER 7:11

God warned them so much to repent and not continue in their evil ways with the mindset that God will never allow the temple to be destroyed because he dwelt there.

They forgot that in the days of Eli and Samuel, the ark was taken away and Shiloh the house of God was destroyed. This is because God does not live in houses as they supposed. The final destination was for God to dwell in his people but they had to be pure and regenerated.

The temple in the time of Jesus was also destroyed because the leaders failed to repent  and this caused a big issue with the people because the population are affected by the acts and decisions of the leaders governing them. Judgement comes from the head

**Related verses**: Jeremiah 7:11, John 2:16. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3617617054284898785)
