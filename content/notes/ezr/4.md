## EZR 4:15

What you do now determines your future. The Samaritans had to use the past against the people of Judah to alter them from building the temple and the wall of Jerusalem.

The devil uses this same tactics to stop you or put a roadblock to your walk with God. Thank God our lovely God don't count our past sins against us.

If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand - Psalms 130:3
