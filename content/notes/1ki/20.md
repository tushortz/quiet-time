## 1KI 20:40

The prophet represented Ahab, the man to be guarded was Ben-Hadad and the man who brought the man to be guarded was God.

God had delivered Ben-Hadad into the hands of Ahab to be devoted for destruction but Ahab made a pact with him and let him escape and Ahab unknowingly pronounced judgement on himself just as David had done when God also sent a prophet to him.

Now the punishment was that Ahab would pay life for life and people for people but fortunately, Ahab repented and judgement passed to the next generation

## 1KI 20:11

You don't know the future. There is no need to boast. Just trust in God and do not worry for the days trouble is enough of itself.

Instead seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and every other things (that people are dying for, going to jail for) will be added unto you
