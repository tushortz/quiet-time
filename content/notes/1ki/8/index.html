<p>wooow that was a lot of sacrifices. Sacrifices release power no wonder the priests could not even enter the temple to minister because of the intense presence of God (the cloud)</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:63. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3455210597833761397">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-854">1KI 8:54</h2>
<p>One of the postures of prayer is to kneel down with hands stretched to heaven. Another is standing, sitting or lying down. I believe that this is the basis for which Muslims do their prayer.</p>
<ul>
<li>standing, then</li>
<li>bending with hands to the knees, then</li>
<li>kneeling with heads touching the floor</li>
<li>then kneeling in a seating position</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:54. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3455207067186094686">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-843">1KI 8:43</h2>
<p>The foreigners had access to God only by coming to Jerusalem to pray towards the temple whereas Jews could get their prayers answered in and outside Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, Jews faced the temple, outside Jerusalem, they faced towards Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This is the similar principles Muslims also use but they face the Kabba instead of the temple of Solomon.</p>
<p>After Christ died on the cross and his body was pierced, Jews as well as Gentiles could now approach God equally without restriction of location</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:43. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454395749130560187">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-838">1KI 8:38</h2>
<p>Through the knowledge of Solomon&rsquo;s prayer, Daniel also knew that he needed to pray towards Jerusalem for God to answer his prayer and the more he prayed, the more understanding and revelation came until he received a visitation from an angel</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:38-39. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454391703648854664">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-834">1KI 8:34</h2>
<p>this is a prophetic reference to when the Israelite would be in exile and if they pray, he would hear and bring them back to the land of Canaan</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:34. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454388789958140526">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-846">1KI 8:46</h2>
<p>There is no one who does not sin</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:46. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454376936376885718">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-830">1KI 8:30</h2>
<p>Heaven is the dwelling place of God. This prayer was answered. Daniel must have known this and this is why he prayed towards Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Every gift in the kingdom of God is acquired through knowledge and is used effectively when understanding comes</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:30, Daniel 6:10. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454367410567242032">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-827">1KI 8:27</h2>
<p>God is very mysterious. He cannot be contained in heaven or earth yet he lives in our heart</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:27. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3454366986590216490">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-845">1KI 8:45</h2>
<p>Solomon knows that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in heaven. His presence (The Holy Spirit) dwelled in the temple in the Most Holy place (Holy of Holies)</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 KINGS 8:44-45. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2652846495418278020">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-833">1KI 8:33</h2>
<p>Sin brings</p>
<ul>
<li>defeat</li>
<li>lack and famine
-.oppression and captivity</li>
</ul>
<p>God is so awesome that irrespective of these sins, when we turn to him immediate by repenting I.e. confessing the sin instead of sugar-coating it and we pray, he will forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 KINGS 8:33, 1 KINGS 8:35, 1 KINGS 8:46. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2652842719127003259">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ki-846-1">1KI 8:46</h2>
<p>Prophecy from Solomon and fulfilled later in the future. The Israelites actually sinned to the point that they were taken captive to Babylon</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Kings 8:46. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2652673058850725965">notes</a></p>
