## 1KI 4:15

The name sounds Egyptian. she's probably the daughter of the Egyptian woman he married.

Basemath doesn't sound like an Israeli name. it may be possible, another daughter of Solomon's foreign wives

**Related verses**: 1 Kings 4:11, 1 Kings 4:15. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3457399628311028722)
