## 1KI 8:63

wooow that was a lot of sacrifices. Sacrifices release power no wonder the priests could not even enter the temple to minister because of the intense presence of God (the cloud)

**Related verses**: 1 Kings 8:63. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3455210597833761397)


## 1KI 8:54

One of the postures of prayer is to kneel down with hands stretched to heaven. Another is standing, sitting or lying down. I believe that this is the basis for which Muslims do their prayer.

- standing, then 
- bending with hands to the knees, then 
- kneeling with heads touching the floor
- then kneeling in a seating position

**Related verses**: 1 Kings 8:54. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3455207067186094686)


## 1KI 8:43

The foreigners had access to God only by coming to Jerusalem to pray towards the temple whereas Jews could get their prayers answered in and outside Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, Jews faced the temple, outside Jerusalem, they faced towards Jerusalem.

This is the similar principles Muslims also use but they face the Kabba instead of the temple of Solomon.

After Christ died on the cross and his body was pierced, Jews as well as Gentiles could now approach God equally without restriction of location

Heaven is the dwelling place of God. This prayer was answered. Daniel must have known this and this is why he prayed towards Jerusalem.

## 1KI 8:35

Sin brings 
- defeat
- lack and famine
-.oppression and captivity

God is so awesome that irrespective of these sins, when we turn to him immediate by repenting I.e. confessing the sin instead of sugar-coating it and we pray, he will forgive us.
