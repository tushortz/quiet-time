## 1JN 4:19

Without God my love is selfish because the true source of love is God.

Lucifer tried to do things without God but realised he couldn't love without him. True love emanates with intimacy with God who alone is love.

Lord help me to have your heart. A heart that unselfishly seeks the best for everyone.
