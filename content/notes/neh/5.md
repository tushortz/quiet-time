## NEH 5:19

Everything Nehemiah did is apparent that he loved God and his people. He did all he could to prevent tauntings from the enemies of the Jews.

He sacrificed many benefits for the good of his people. A good leader can be known by how much he is willing to sacrifice his comfort for the things of God first then his people.

This characteristic is lacking in the part of many leaders of nations.

Nehemiah prayed to God to remember him and after almost 3000 years, we still read about him
