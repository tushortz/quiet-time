<p>One of the reasons God forbid the ways of the heathen. Child sacrifice was part of it and they sacrificed these to demons.</p>
<p>God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac long ago, it may have been a common practice in the time of Abraham but Abraham was willing to do so not to a demon but to the true God because Hebrews 11 tells us that ABRAHAM BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD.</p>
<p>whereas these demons can&rsquo;t raise people from the dead. The act was forbidden by God as an abomination and the sacrifice made by the king of Moab caused such a great fury that the allies of the king of Israel left him.</p>
<p>What are you sacrificing for God? God can only use what you sacrifice to him like your time, strength. If you don&rsquo;t sacrifice these things to God, you will do it for devils</p>

<h2 id="2ki-320">2KI 3:20</h2>
<p>The miracles of the water happened in the morning AFTER the sacrifice has been offered. What are withholding from God that is preventing your valley to be filled with water.</p>
<p>The Edomite king also found a way to stop the war by offering his son as a sacrifice to his god chemosh.</p>

<h2 id="2ki-315">2KI 3:15</h2>
<p>Music (worship) is sometimes needed for the prophetic anointing. Worship sets a good atmosphere for the presence of God to be tangible.</p>
<p>Even in ancient religion, music was used to arouse evil spirits so that their presence will be tangible. These things are used even in traditional masquerading.</p>
