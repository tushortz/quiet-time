## 2KI 5:17

The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.

Jews should face 
* the temple when in Jerusalem
* Jerusalem when outside Canaan

Gentiles
* need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple

Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.

Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :). The revelation that gentiles could also worship God outside the Holy land can be seen when Namaan asked Elisha if it was possible and Elisha gave a yes to the question
