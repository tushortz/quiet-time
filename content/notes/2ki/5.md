## 2KI 5:5

3000 shekels = 1 talent
1 talent = 15 years wages (approximately)

Naaman took 12 talents in total and 10 changes of clothing.

if the hill of Samaria was bought for 2 talents and it became the official residence of the kings of Israel then imagine 12 talents.

12 talents being around 180 years of wages. now I see why Gehazi would have wanted to bank on a once in a lifetime event.

## 2KI 5:18

The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.

Jews should face 
* the temple when in Jerusalem
* Jerusalem when outside Canaan

Gentiles
* need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple

Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.

Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :). The revelation that gentiles could also worship God outside the Holy land can be seen when Namaan asked Elisha if it was possible and Elisha gave a yes to the question

## 2KI 5:25

Gehazi was greedy and a liar. He could have been the servant on which the mighty anointing of Elisha would be transferred to. He could have gotten more but Gehazi's bad attitude prevented him from getting the anointing.

Judas as well was one of the Apostles but greed caused him damage. He lost his office, reputation and his life
