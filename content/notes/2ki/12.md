## 2KI 12:15

Faithfulness gives peace. Others don't have to worry about a lot of things when you are faithful

## 2KI 12:3

Although the king tried to eradicate idolatry, the people still burnt sacrifices on the high places where idolatry was usually done.

This is because the temple of God was not yet renovated and Joash saw to it that it was done. Unfortunately, he was assassinated by two of his servants for murdering Zachariah the high priest and son of Jehoiada.

Jehoash/Joash was the 7th king from David when excluding Queen Athaliah's 7 year wicked rule
