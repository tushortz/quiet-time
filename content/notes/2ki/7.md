## 2KI 7:9

The Gospel must be preached. It is not good for us to eat of the goodness of the Lord Jesus without proclaiming it to the unsaved. 

Some punishment will come to us if we just shut up and let people go to hell.

Although we are saved but people must also be saved. We must bear fruits so we will get rewards in heaven. Besides there is also joy when people get saved
