<p>The messengers of the king of Assyria recounted their victories to instil fear in the men of Judah.</p>
<p>David recounted his past testimonies until he won the victory over Goliath. - 1 Samuel 17:37</p>
<p>They overcame the devil by the blood of the lamb and THE WORD OF THEIR TESTIMONY - Revelation 12:11</p>
<p>Our testimony makes us overcomers.</p>

<h2 id="2ki-1836">2KI 18:36</h2>
<p>They say &ldquo;Silence is the best answer for a fool&rdquo; and that has worked many times.</p>
<p>Hezekiah was silent in the face of opposition threat and boasting. Jesus was also silent when questioned by Pilate and the chief priests when he was being tried.</p>
<p>Be still and know that God is God and he is able to rescue you from the furnace of oppression</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 KINGS 18:36. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2667268379404657345">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-1835">2KI 18:35</h2>
<p>Stupid question full of pride. The king of Assyria tested the The Lord of host and got more than he bargained for. They relied on their on strength and inventions</p>
<p>The fact that God is chastising his people don&rsquo;t mean we have gained the upper hand and should start to mistreat them.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 KINGS 18:35. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2667266760562696870">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-185">2KI 18:5</h2>
<p>What a great memorial. So much faith in God. Even though his dad did evil and led people to idolatry, he got rid of them.</p>
<p>His obedience lead to success and he was able to stand against the Assyrian empire the great nation of his day.</p>
<p>When you are obedient and the Lord is with you, you can stand against every Goliath, you can move every mountain.</p>
<p>He was a David in the making. Not many of the kings of Judah was said of that &ldquo;The Lord was with him&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As far as I know, only the kings that this was said of was David, Solomon, Asa and Hezekiah</p>
