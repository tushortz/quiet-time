## 2KI 11:2

Athaliah was even willing to kill her grandson. She was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel who were very wicked and served other gods.

She killed all the king's offspring except one (Joash) who was hid by Jehosheba the half-sister of king Joram father of Ahaziah. This was when Joash was some months old.

Joash became the youngest serving king of Judah while Athaliah became the first recorded woman to reign as king and as you know, her reign was disastrous because she took after her parents.
