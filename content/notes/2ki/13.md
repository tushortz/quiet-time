## 2KI 13:21

Elisha was so anointed that his dead bones still retained the anointing to raise the dead. Elisha  was very sick probably because of old age. 

He had witness a minimum of 63 years of about 6 different kings reign.

There was no one who the double potion of the anointing or more was passed on. Gehazi could have been the one to inherit the strong anointing. This anointing made Elijah and Elisha relate with Kings. This strong prophetic anointing was so strong that it put the prophet far above kings. They were respected by Kings. In more than one instance. Elisha was called a father by different kings.


Gehazi lost an opportunity to get this opportunity because of greed. Elisha told him when he collected things from Namaan the Syrian that this wasn't the time to receive gifts. Gehazi lost in his inheritance and ended up a leper (he substituted the prophetic anointing for (pieces of clothes and valuables) for leprosy.
