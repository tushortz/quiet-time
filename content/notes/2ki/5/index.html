<p>1 talent of gold was approximately 15 years of wages. Naaman brought</p>

<h2 id="2ki-517">2KI 5:17</h2>
<p>If Elisha had received the presents, he would have denied God of his glory because Naaman only thought of collecting the soil to worship God after his gifts had been rejected</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Kings 5:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3506645502337475330">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-516">2KI 5:16</h2>
<p>God does not collect before he gives.</p>
<p>Freely you have received, freely give.</p>
<p>Our life is meant to embody the law and the prophets like Jesus did</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Kings 5:16, Matthew 10:8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3506643824842367738">notes</a></p>

<p>obedience in the little things</p>

<p>3000 shekels = 1 talent
1 talent = 15 years wages (approximately)</p>
<p>Naaman took 12 talents in total and 10 changes of clothing.</p>
<p>if the hill of Samaria was bought for 2 talents and it became the official residence of the kings of Israel then imagine 12 talents.</p>
<p>12 talents being around 180 years of wages. now I see why Gehazi would have wanted to bank on a once in a lifetime event.</p>

<h2 id="2ki-518">2KI 5:18</h2>
<p>The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.</p>
<p>Jews should face</p>
<ul>
<li>the temple when in Jerusalem</li>
<li>Jerusalem when outside Canaan</li>
</ul>
<p>Gentiles</p>
<ul>
<li>need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple</li>
</ul>
<p>Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.</p>
<p>Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :). The revelation that gentiles could also worship God outside the Holy land can be seen when Namaan asked Elisha if it was possible and Elisha gave a yes to the question</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Kings 5:17-19, 2 Chronicles 6:24, 2 Chronicles 6:28-39. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3455202823540302414">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-525">2KI 5:25</h2>
<p>Gehazi was greedy and a liar. He could have been the servant on which the mighty anointing of Elisha would be transferred to. He could have gotten more but Gehazi&rsquo;s bad attitude prevented him from getting the anointing.</p>
<p>Judas as well was one of the Apostles but greed caused him damage. He lost his office, reputation and his life</p>

<p>Naaman heard of the God of Israel. Faith was born. He got healed after obeying the word of [the man of] God and became a believer.</p>
<p>Faith, healing, salvation, baptism and confession</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 KINGS 5:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2663069632495870413">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-518-1">2KI 5:18</h2>
<p>Naaman was pardoned to worship in the house of Rimmon when his master the King wants to worship. This is because Naaman&rsquo;s true intention wasn&rsquo;t to worship those gods but unchangeable circumstance made him do it</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 KINGS 5:18. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2663068418723013059">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ki-510">2KI 5:10</h2>
<p>Pride would have cost Naaman his healing. Sometimes what seems little is actually the solution but we want something that sounds very big and costs us a lot. This is religion</p>
