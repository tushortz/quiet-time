## GEN 24:65

It was customary to cover the bride with a veil before marriage as is still done in several cultures today.

likewise when we are married to Christ, the veil is removed and we begin to behold Christ. 

I must not take my gaze away from Christ. The apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3


14 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. 15 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. 16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away
