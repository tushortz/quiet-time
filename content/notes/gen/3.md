## GEN 3:6

Adam was called Eve's husband which means they had gotten married. so any notion of them having sex wouldn't have been a sin. 

This is for people who thinks the sin and the real forbidden fruit was having sex. that is untrue and unscriptural.

**Related verses**: GENESIS 3:6. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3206728013459481089)


## GEN 3:22

It is God's mercy that we were prevented from living forever in our fallen state because we wouldn't have been able to die since the wages of sin is death.

We would be like demons walking around uncomfortably and seeking animal bodies to indwell. Mercy oh Lord.

Because without death, Jesus cannot die on the cross for our sins since we would have lived forever therefore eternally damned and separated from God. that is hell itself.

## GEN 3:16

Shame, pain, sorrow and demotion are the results of a curse whereas fruitfulness, abundance and authority (promotion) are the results of a blessing

**Related verses**: GENESIS 3:16. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3206442390089621636)


## GEN 3:14

God had previously blessed man but God didn't curse man afterwards. He rather cursed the serpent and the ground because they had not received God's blessings.

**Related verses**: GENESIS 3:14, GENESIS 3:17. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3206441283313459289)


## GEN 3:14

Notice God did not bless the cattle and wild animals on the day they were created but the blessed the birds of the air and the dishes of the sea.

Also now realise that God cursed the ground. Was it because God had already blessed thecreatures of the sea and air that is why he didn't curse them?

## GEN 3:12

Eve was given to Adam by God. In Jewish culture, it's the father of the groom who finds a wife for the groom and a token is given to the bride as a guarantee that the marriage was taking place and will be consumated.

I wonder what God gave to Eve?

## GEN 3:9

God threw questions to Adam in rapid succession. Mercy

## GEN 3:10

Adam heard the sound of God walking...

Although God is spirit yet Adam could hear the sound of his footsteps. He could distinguish this was the steps and the voice of God

## GEN 3:5

Where there is no law, there is no sin and judgement is not put into action.

As long as Eve didn't know the difference between right and wrong, she was sinless but as soon as she ate the forbidden fruit, her conscience was awakened and she knew sin.

## GEN 3:4

Best because someone looks and sounds confident of what he is saying doesn't mean Jack. I must be careful of what I hear and judge it by the word of God.

Even if an Angel preaches another gospel, let them be cursed as the serpent was cursed.

* Galatians 1:8

## GEN 3:1

Foolish questions. I must learn to avoid foolish questions and thoughts that make me doubt the word of God.

Just like Eve was tempted with silly questions so was Jesus. Jesus stood by the word of God but unfortunately ignorance of the word cost Eve then Adam
