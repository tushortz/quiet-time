<p>The blessings of the Lord makes rich. It always increase</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Genesis 1:28, Proverbs 10:22, Isaiah 51:2. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3584916643228934649">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="gen-130">GEN 1:30</h2>
<p>Before the fall of man, the food given to mankind was every green plant and fruit-bearing tree with SEED in it. This islso brings to mind the notion of fruitfulness.</p>
<p>After the fall of man, eating animals was included but blood was forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: GENESIS 1:29-30. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3206416384809231200">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="gen-128-1">GEN 1:28</h2>
<p>God blessed the first and last of his living creatures but the last was given dominion.</p>
<p>It seems God favours the last than the first just like in the life and genealogy of Adam, Abraham and down.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: GENESIS 1:28. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3206030413974462857">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="gen-121">GEN 1:21</h2>
<p>It is God&rsquo;s blessings to be fruitful. Fruitfulness is a sign of blessing. the first recorded blessing pronounced by God is on the fifth day.</p>
<p>God blessed the creatures of the sea and the air but there was no record of God blessing the land animals during creation</p>
<p>Every mention of extinction is a curse. Being few is a curse</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: GENESIS 1:21-22. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3206023632799916311">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="gen-12">GEN 1:2</h2>
<p>Before the spirit moved, the earth was in chaos, a state of emptiness and darkness.</p>
<p>When the spirit moved, there was a transformation because the word was spoken and the light appeared. The spirit and the word was needed before anything was done.</p>
<p>The father was silent until the Holy Spirit moved then the father called the son to show up and his light filled the earth.</p>
<p>The son claims, I am the light of the world - John 8:12</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: GENESIS 1:2-3. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2574515929678078773">notes</a></p>
