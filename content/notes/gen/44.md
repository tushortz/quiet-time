## GEN 44:33

Repentance
What a transformation. The Judah that was behind selling Joseph as a slave in times past was now willing to be in place of Benjamin as a servant of Joseph. Great sign of repentance. The brothers of Joseph had come to realise that they acted foolishly are now regretting their past actions

When you repent, it shows in your actions and words
