## GEN 46:4

Faith
Even though Jacob knew his families were going to suffer in Egypt for 400+ years,  he still obeyed God. Even though he didn't live to witness those years of suffering nor did he get the inheritance in his lifetime,  he still proceeded into Egypt with his family. 

Sometimes,  it is God's will that we go through a very difficult time in our life. God has his plan and his reward but are we willing to trust him even though we don't see the big picture or do we want to do it our own way and bear the consequences. 

Should the best sailor direct the ship or should an inexperienced me direct the sheep. Trust God.
