            1CH 7:24 Even though Beriah?s name means (on misfortune), he bore a daughter who made a good name. We?ve always read about men building cities but this lady whose name was Sheerah made a name for herself.
The fact that you had a past shouldn?t determine your future. She could have decided that since my father?s name means misfortune, then I would continue to live unfortunate by doing nothing. But no, that didn?

        <p>
            JON 1:6 It is amazing that it was the unbeliever captain that went to tell Jonah to stay awake and call on his God. Many times, we neglect our duty as Christians and it takes the unbelievers to awake us from our slumber.
The unbelievers even though they don?t believe in God, they can tell from your actions if you are truly a Christian because they expect a certain standard from you and if you are short of it, why will they believe in your God.
