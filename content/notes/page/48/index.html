        <p>
            JAS 4:7 I need to submit to God?s word and his authority then resist the devil.
Submission comes before resistance. I must resist evil after I have submitted to God and he will flee from me. My submission to God gives me authority over the devil.
Submission means to place yourself in the control of another.
Just as yielding myself to do evil continually makes the Holy Spirit depart from me so is the same with yielding myself to God.

JAS 2:14 Genuine faith produces good works.
Related verses: JAMES 2:14. See notes
JAS 2:24 It is faith in Jesus that saves us and not works. Valid faith is shown through works that is why every faith must be accompanied by evidence.

I cannot claim to be a Christian and still use curse words.
Related verses: JAMES 1:26. See notes
JAS 1:19 Quick to hear, slow speak.
Paying attention to God&rsquo;s words and being slow to speak so you don&rsquo;t say anything rash.
Even a fool is thought to be wise when he keeps his mouth shut.

The priest served as the teacher of the law and an intermediary and an intercessor between God and man.

            HEB 2:16 Salvation was to humanity and not to fallen angels in the sense that Jesus being able to die due to being made in 5he likeness of men an men originally being made in the likeness of God.
Since Christ could die for the sins of man (the wages of sin is death), and angels are immortal (impossible to be redeemed through death).

        <p>
            1TI 2:15 The message version of this verse best explains it.
I have been wondering what apostle Paul was saying but i now I know that after Eve fell from transgression, she also got us the opportunity to be saved through childbearing which happened because a woman also gave birth to a saviour. Although the means of redemption has been provided, everyone still has the responsibility to work out their salvation through faith, love and holiness.
