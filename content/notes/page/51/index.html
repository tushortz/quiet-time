        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 19:13 Many people deserted Job in his affliction. It is easy to say you suffered this because you have sinned but that&rsquo;s not always true. Job is so confident that he hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong that he is willing to go to court with God but needs a lawyer. But what lawyer can even stand before the almighty God.
Job accused God of doing evil to him. Although God didn&rsquo;t do any of these.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">JOB 3</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 3:25 Job always sacrificed animals for his children because he thought they might have cursed God in their heart but unfortunately, they died anyway.
One thing to notice is that Satan is trying to break the link between righteousness and blessings, so that he would expose the righteous man for the sinner he is (by cursing God) - NASB study Bible
It is also great to know that God himself didn&rsquo;t kill any of Job&rsquo;s children nor did he inflict him with sores or ruin his business.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">EST 10</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EST 10:3 Just like Joseph was, Mordecai was also second in command to the king of a heathen nation. He was also great and the reason for his greatest us described.
Because he worked for the good of his people and spoke for the welfare and peace of his nation.
There is no need to be jealous or angry. When you are in power, you can&rsquo;t use it for evil or you will be destroyed.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">EST 9</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EST 9:4 Godliness gains you greatness, respect and fame.
We look for these three things in the wrong places but true godliness, respect and fame can only be found when we are into our heavenly father&rsquo;s business as the Lord Jesus did.
&ldquo;I must work the works of him that sent me&rdquo; - John 9:4

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">EST 8</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EST 8:17 God can make a bad thing good and he did. God never forsook his people even in the land of captivity. It is amazing how not once was God mentioned in the whole of this book but the Jews had to fast and pray until their captivity was turned.
God had used Mordecai and Esther to bring relief to the Jews and salvation to the gentiles. This story of Esther and Mordecai is quite similar to the story of Joseph.
