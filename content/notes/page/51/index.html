        <p>
            2CH 31:21 Everything that involves working for God requires doing with all our heart. No double-mindedness or half-heartedness. It also involves seeking and longing for God First before it becomes prosperous.

        <p>
            2CH 25:16 Not taking heed of advises especially one sent by God is dangerous. Amaziah shut up the prophet of God when he was sent to warn Amaziah.
Other examples of bad experience after rejecting advices are:
 The prophet told not to eat in Bethel when he warned Jeroboam (1 Kings 13) Rehoboam when advised by Elders to lighten the yoke of the people (2 Chronicles 10:6-8) King Ahab when warned by Micaiah not to go to battle (2 Chronicles 18:14-22) David when advices by Joab not to take a census of the people (1 Chronicles 21:2-7)  Related verses: 2 CHRONICLES 25:16.

        <p>
            2CH 18:1 That was a terrible mistake. After this Judah could not remain the same again. Intermarrying with the daughter of an idolater, prostitute and witch.
Athaliah, the wife of Jehoshaphat almost destroyed the seed of kingship through Judah and through which the Lord Jesus Christ would come. That would have been a fatal disaster for all of us and we would be damned but thank God he is always in control of things

        <p>
            2CH 11:16 In the face of adversity is the true content of a person revealed. It was during the division of these two kingdoms that the people who really wanted to seek God left their inheritance in Israel to live in Judah while others could not leave everything they own and would rather worship goat demons that Jeroboam the son of Nebat made.
Israel never remained the same again and this was just a beginning till they finally ended up in Babylon

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            2CH 10:7 There is something about kindness that makes people gladly obey you. Unfortunately Rehoboam the son of Solomon was begged to be kind to them and they will serve him forever but he rejected the counsel of the elders who had been with Solomon and took advice from the young men who had grown up with him.
Unfortunately, that was a disastrous decision and he lost control of 10 of the kingdoms because the people rebelled against him.

        <p>
            1CH 13:10 God had commanded in Exodus 25:12-15 that the ark should be carried on poles through the four rings. The instruction was followed by the Israelites during the times of Moses and Aaron up until the Philistines captured it.
The Philistines did send it back on cows because they didn?t know better but they at least showed respect and God honoured it by allowing their guess [if the oxen went towards the land of Israel] to come to pass to show that it was him (God) who struck the Philistines with tumours.
