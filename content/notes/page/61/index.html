            JOS 10:25 The Lord has put his feet on the neck of our enemies.
This reminds me of Psalm 110:1 - the Lord says to my Lord, sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies at your feet. Jesus is sitting with the father and until the church which is the body of Christ trample Satan under our feet. Jesus has already won the victory and now we need to enforce it.

            JOS 9:14 It is always good to hear from God before making any treaty. It could look good to be friends but it could be a friendship based on deception.

        <p>
            JOS 5:9 Named after the new generations were circumcised removing the foreskin of their private part. A removal of the old and an appearance of the new.
This involved shedding of blood. The Old Testament also involved shedding of blood.
Removing the old self and putting on a new self. Old things have passed away. All things become new.
Circumcision also means: May it be done to you as this foreskin (cut off from the rest) if you do not obey the commandments of God

            JOS 2:18 Rahab&rsquo;s identity was tied to that scarlet cloth. It was the means of salvation between the Jews (the two spies) and gentile (Rahab). Rahab kept the Passover through the scarlet cloth which was a type of Jesus and her household were saved
