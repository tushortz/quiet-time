            MRK 9:7 The testimony of the father was confirmed in the Jordan River where Jacob wrestled with an angel after he crossed it and received a blessing.
The Jordan was also where Jesus received the anointing after being baptized. The Jordan was also where Elisha had received the double portion of the anointing when they divided it and crossed on foot.
The father also testified on the mountain. John the Baptist the first witness, the three disciples (Peter, James and John), the second witness.

        <p>
            ISA 58:5 Fasting is a means of humbling myself. It should also be a time to mourn for my sins and produce a repentant heart (poor in Spirit)
It looks like this fasting was done on the Sabbath because it was the only day that God did not permit work.
Fasting makes my voice heard. Fasting is not just about depriving the body of food even though it&rsquo;s a means of starving the flesh to stuff the Spirit.
