            JDG 7:10 We need no rely on the arms of flesh because the everlasting arms is ready to help us. The battle was God&rsquo;s and yet he needed men to appear in battle. God had to separate the fearful and unbelieving among the people

            JDG 2:22 The reason God didn&rsquo;t fully drive out the people of the pagan nations in times of Joshua was to test their loyalty
Faithfulness is being constant and independent of circumstance. This is one of the reasons God doesn&rsquo;t good us the full measure of the Holy Spirit.
God will give us little and test us to make sure we are faithful with the little. Then he increase and increase until he can trust us fully.
