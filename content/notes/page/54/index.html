Related verses: 2 KINGS 14:27. See notes
2KI 14:9 Amaziah king of Judah is the thorn bush, Joash king of Israel is the tall cedar of Lebanon.
Judah&rsquo;s defeat of Edom caused Amaziah to be proud so he wanted to war with the king of Israel

            2KI 13:21 Elisha was so anointed that his dead bones still retained the anointing to raise the dead. Elisha was very sick probably because of old age.
He had witness a minimum of 63 years of about 6 different kings reign.
There was no one who the double potion of the anointing or more was passed on. Gehazi could have been the one to inherit the strong anointing. This anointing made Elijah and Elisha relate with Kings.

            2KI 10:31 Even though Jehu was an instrument of God&rsquo;s judgement on King Ahab, he killed many other unnecessary people like King Ahaziah.
It seems he was more motivated by politics rather than actually serving the Lord. Although God commended him for executing God&rsquo;s judgement, he was rebuked by the prophet Hosea

Related verses: 2 KINGS 12:15. See notes
2KI 12:3 Although the king tried to eradicate idolatry, the people still burnt sacrifices on the high places where idolatry was usually done.
This is because the temple of God was not yet renovated and Joash saw to it that it was done. Unfortunately, he was assassinated by two of his servants for murdering Zachariah the high priest and son of Jehoiada.

        <p>
            2KI 11:2 Athaliah was even willing to kill her grandson. She was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel who were very wicked and served other gods.
She killed all the king&rsquo;s offspring except one (Joash) who was hid by Jehosheba the half-sister of king Joram father of Ahaziah. This was when Joash was some months old.
Joash became the youngest serving king of Judah while Athaliah became the first recorded woman to reign as king and as you know, her reign was disastrous because she took after her parents.
