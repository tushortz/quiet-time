Related verses: Exodus 1:21. See notes
EXO 1:17 The two Hebrew midwives feared God and didn&rsquo;t commit murder. You don&rsquo;t have to do the will of your boss if it goes against God&rsquo;s will.
If the Hebrew midwives had terminated Moses, Joshua or Caleb&rsquo;s life, Israel would have rotted in Egypt without a deliverer.

Related verses: Job 42:12. See notes
JOB 42:8 Job&rsquo;s friend Eliphaz wasn&rsquo;t present when God spoke to Job. I believe none of Job&rsquo;s other friends were around because God told Eliphaz to go to Job with 7 bulls and 7 rams so he could act as priest on their behalf

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 36:14 Some of the cult prostitutes were homosexuals. it was seen as a fertility rite and oh my goodness, what a terrible atrocity.
I believe this is the same practice in Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim.
I believe they indulged in idol worship which permitted them to indulge in homosexuality and that became the culture of the city.
unfortunately this is where all false religion ends up people in.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">JOB 23</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 23:10 Job is confident he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to deserve anything he was facing due to the understanding of his time that blessings is directly proportional to godliness (which is actually true in the long run).
Job is now experienced to know that in the short run that isn&rsquo;t necessarily always true yet his friends accuse him of wickedness.
Job thinks when God has tried him, he will be found innocent of the punishment he&rsquo;s facing due to his sin.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 22:30 lol it&rsquo;s actually funny that this was exactly what happened to Eliphaz. God told Job to pray for his three friends after they had misrepresented God and said false statements about Job&rsquo;s integrity
Related verses: Job 22:30. See notes
JOB 22:5 False accusations. we can&rsquo;t judge by circumstances the Integrity of a person.
in ancient times blessings is directly associated with righteous and the devil tries to break this bond by imploring God to do that in the life of Job.

        <p>
            1JN 4:19 Without God my love is selfish because the true source of love is God.
Lucifer tried to do things without God but realised he couldn&rsquo;t love without him. True love emanates with intimacy with God who alone is love.
Lord help me to have your heart. A heart that unselfishly seeks the best for everyone.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            PSA 91:1 The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me.
I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that&rsquo;s another level.
Jesus already promised he&rsquo;s with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.
