            MRK 15:38 On the sabbath there was no buying and selling and work so Jesus had to die earlier otherwise his body would not be buried and although the death of the crucified usually lasted about 2 to 3 days, Jesus died just six hours after being crucified because he willingly released his spirit. Because there was only three hours left, Jesus was buried before the sabbath started.
There was no time to embalm him and Jews didn?
