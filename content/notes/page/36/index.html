            1SA 17:37 this should be my confession. if God has saved me many times from death, he will surely rescue me whenever I am in trouble
Related verses: 1 Samuel 17:37. See notes
1SA 17:18 David had been anointed as king for war but was still feeding the sheep and delivering cheese. he was still an errand boy until the Holy Spirit moved his father to send him on delivery. this marked a milestone for his future.

            1SA 15:12 God gave the Victory but Saul took the glory
Related verses: 1 Samuel 15:12. See notes
1SA 15:9 The sin here is that they consciously disobeyed God by destroying every bad thing but left the best. Willful selection. Saul spared Agag because he wanted it to boost his ego since Agag has become his prisoner of war.
For those who were with Saul, he wanted to be the respected king among them by giving them the best of the spoils of war but the booty was God&rsquo;s because everything was to be devoted to destruction.

Related verses: 1 Samuel 9:19. See notes

        <p>
            1SA 5:7 God would not be manipulated to act on my behalf especially when I am living a sinful lifestyle. neither would God share his glory with any other. The ark of God was placed before Dagon to show Dagon&rsquo;s superiority but God struck Dagon and he fell before the ark thus God was showing his superiority.
God also struck the Philistine cities with plagues as he did in Egypt. he first struck their gods then their 5 lords, then the people.
