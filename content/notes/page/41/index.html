            1JN 4:19 Without God my love is selfish because the true source of love is God.
Lucifer tried to do things without God but realised he couldn&rsquo;t love without him. True love emanates with intimacy with God who alone is love.
Lord help me to have your heart. A heart that unselfishly seeks the best for everyone.

        <p>
            PSA 91:1 The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me.
I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that&rsquo;s another level.
Jesus already promised he&rsquo;s with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.

Related verses: 2 CORINTHIANS 3:14. See notes
2CO 3:14 People cannot understand the truth let alone believe it because their minds had been blinded by a veil caused by Satan. The veil can only be removed when we believe in Jesus.
This is why evangelists and preachers are needed

            GEN 28:22 A tithe is a sign of dependence on God. The stone as a pillar was a memorial of covenant between Jacob and God.

            LUK 19:26 God has given me a gift but I have disregarded it. I need to work harder because of the day fo accountability. If I want it to be increased I have to step out in faith and ignore my reputation and what people say about me. In the end I am only working for God and the fear of man will put me in a snare

            MAT 20:15 I must be generous because God is generous. He saw that these last workers were idle not because they were lazy but they were unlucky to have not been hired then he decided to hire them for the same price.
I must not be jealous because others are treated better than me. We all have different walk with God but he chooses whom he favours.
