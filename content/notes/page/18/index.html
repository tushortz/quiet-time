            DEU 17:16 Disobedience against God&rsquo;s law that a king is not to multiply chariots so that his heart remains trusting in God and not on weapons of war and natural abilities and skills.
this is the beginning of the downfall of Solomon

        <p>
            2CH 9:27 Another thing to note in Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom is not just in building but in transportation. he controlled nations through control of the trade routes. that way riches reached Israel

        <p>
            1KI 9:15 Solomon a wise man was always involved in building projects. He built structures for 20 years. He built the temple, his house, house of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, he even built fortifications and ships.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            GEN 19:3 A sign of the communion. they had communion before judgement. Jesus had communion before he faced judgement on the cross. The Israelites had communion before judgement fell on Egypt.
The communion and the unleavened bread was to show that there is no sin in me and the wine is a sign of purity. After you crush me, you will find no dreggs in me.
But Jesus had to drink of the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath and taste the dreggs.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">EZK 22</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            EZK 22:4 God&rsquo;s judgement was because of idolatry and bloodshed. A direct desecration of the golden rule. To love God and others.
Sodom and Gomorrah was involved in this. Homosexuality was a common practise in Sodom and Gomorrah. Male temple prostitutes also engaged in homosexual acts in pagan religion.
Before God judges the earth, there had to be an outcry by humans bringing into account the deeds of the offenders.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">LEV 16</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            LEV 16:13 the purpose of the incense and the fire was to create a cloud of smoke which would then cover the mercy seat so that the high priest would not come into direct eye contact with God when he sprinkles the blood on the mercy seat. this is because the glory of God will be manifested
Related verses: Leviticus 16:2, Leviticus 16:13. See notes
LEV 16:15 The High priest was to offer two sacrifices on the day of atonement.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">2CH 7</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            2CH 7:3 this word of worship is very common in the Bible
&ldquo;For he is good, for his mercies endures forever&rdquo;
Related verses: 2 Chronicles 7:3. See notes
2CH 7:1 Fire came down from the altar and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices in response to Solomon&rsquo;s prayer and God&rsquo;s glory filled the temple

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">1KI 8</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            1KI 8:63 wooow that was a lot of sacrifices. Sacrifices release power no wonder the priests could not even enter the temple to minister because of the intense presence of God (the cloud)
Related verses: 1 Kings 8:63. See notes
1KI 8:54 One of the postures of prayer is to kneel down with hands stretched to heaven. Another is standing, sitting or lying down. I believe that this is the basis for which Muslims do their prayer.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">2CH 6</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            2CH 6:33 The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.
Jews should face
 the temple when in Jerusalem Jerusalem when outside Canaan  Gentiles
 need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple  Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.
Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :).
