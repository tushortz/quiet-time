        <p>
            MAT 1:21 Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.
Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it.

        <p>
            PRO 3:4 I find favour in the sight of God and man because of the three qualities: mercy, kindness and truth.
mercy and truth because God desires both and kindness in judgement will make me show compassion. God is full of compassion

        <p>
            PSA 121:2 The hills of Jerusalem (City of peace) is where the high places of worship was located before Solomon built the temple on mount Moriah. Looking up to the hills is looking up to God and trusting him for provision. I cannot rely on man to provide for me but only God is the source and provider of my needs and is very happy to do so.
God will be there to keep the path I walk when I live righteously.

        <p>
            PRO 2:1 Seeking the knowledge of God as if mining gold is the criteria to finding wisdom. it&rsquo;s not easy to get treasures and neither is it easy to know God. only those who knows the value of knowing God will seek him.
once we find God, God willbimpart to us his wisdom because we seek him on the basis of his word and the more we know his word, the more we start to become acquainted with him and can know what steps to take if in a dilemma.

            1KI 4:15 The name sounds Egyptian. she&rsquo;s probably the daughter of the Egyptian woman he married.
