        <p>
            NUM 4:15 God had commanded in Exodus 25:12-15 that the ark should be carried on poles through the four rings. The instruction was followed by the Israelites during the times of Moses and Aaron up until the Philistines captured it.
The Philistines did send it back on cows because they didn?t know better but they at least showed respect and God honoured it by allowing their guess [if the oxen went towards the land of Israel] to come to pass to show that it was him (God) who struck the Philistines with tumours.

Who can stand against the Lord of Host. Not even the devil or any witch, wizard, demon or occultist power can withstand such mighty force from the Lord.

            1CH 7:24 Even though Beriah?s name means (on misfortune), he bore a daughter who made a good name. We?ve always read about men building cities but this lady whose name was Sheerah made a name for herself.
The fact that you had a past shouldn?t determine your future. She could have decided that since my father?s name means misfortune, then I would continue to live unfortunate by doing nothing. But no, that didn?

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JON 1:6 It is amazing that it was the unbeliever captain that went to tell Jonah to stay awake and call on his God. Many times, we neglect our duty as Christians and it takes the unbelievers to awake us from our slumber.
The unbelievers even though they don?t believe in God, they can tell from your actions if you are truly a Christian because they expect a certain standard from you and if you are short of it, why will they believe in your God.

            EZK 44:23 The Levitical priests of God are sanctified and Holiness is transmitted to the people when they came in contact with the priest clothes that was used to serve God. God forbade that they should wear the clothes to serve the people. Instead, they should change there garments before ministering to the people.
They were also to teach the people the things of God. The Holy and unholy and also teach them to distinguish between the clean and the ceremonially unclean.
