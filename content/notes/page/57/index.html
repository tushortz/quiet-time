            1SA 31:12 Irrespective of how rebellious or ungodly you are, doing good in the past will help you one day. Saul had previously helped the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead when Nahash the ammonite came against them.
This time, they repaid Saul&rsquo;s kindness by giving him a decent burial instead of a shameful one by getting his body from the wall of Beth-Shan (the Philistines intention was for people passing by to Mock Saul and Israel as people passed by) and hail their gods

            1SA 13:13 Even though it was true Saul waited the seven days he was commanded to, if he had waited longer and not allowed fear to overcome him, his kingdom would have been established forever.
If I was Saul I probably would have done the same except if I knew that it was wrong to sacrifice when you are not anointed to stand in the office of a priest. Lord give me wisdom to know the way to go, the things to do and the steps to take.
