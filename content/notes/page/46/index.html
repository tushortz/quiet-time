            ACT 4:3 Just after they had received the Holy Spirit and Peter had won 3000 souls, a lame man has also been healed and Peter and John had their first recorded prison experience.
It is inevitable to walk in Jesus anointing and not be persecuted. Jesus had warned previously that if they can do that to the master, the disciples should get ready to experience the same.

            JHN 9:14 The sabbath was a day of rest not a day of burdens. A day of freedom not a day of religious exercise.
Jesus freed the man on sabbath as much as he did miracles most of the time on the sabbath.
Jesus himself is our sabbath.
?Come to me all that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest?

        <p>
            2CH 33:13 God is ever gracious. Even when his temple had been profaned with idols and Manasseh had practiced all manner of abominations, God still heard his prayer.
Many times, it takes a very bad situation before we can humble ourselves and come to God. May God help us all but the good thing is God?s arm is always opened wide to receive us.

            2CH 25:16 Not taking heed of advises especially one sent by God is dangerous. Amaziah shut up the prophet of God when he was sent to warn Amaziah.
Other examples of bad experience after rejecting advices are:
 The prophet told not to eat in Bethel when he warned Jeroboam (1 Kings 13) Rehoboam when advised by Elders to lighten the yoke of the people (2 Chronicles 10:6-8) King Ahab when warned by Micaiah not to go to battle (2 Chronicles 18:14-22) David when advices by Joab not to take a census of the people (1 Chronicles 21:2-7)  Related verses: 2 CHRONICLES 25:16.
