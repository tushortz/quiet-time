            LUK 14:27 You can&rsquo;t love anyone more than yourself naturally that&rsquo;s why Jesus said love your NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.
the most important person I need to lose is MYSELF. Ministry is work and God pays for our services.
he has already paid me through the blood of his son Jesus.
 PUT GOD FIRST. GIVE YOUR TIME AND EFFORT  pride is putting yourself first.

            GEN 24:65 It was customary to cover the bride with a veil before marriage as is still done in several cultures today.
likewise when we are married to Christ, the veil is removed and we begin to behold Christ.
I must not take my gaze away from Christ. The apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3
14 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read.
