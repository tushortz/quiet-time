            2CH 21:10 You earn rebellion when you rebel against God (the highest authority). You also lose your dominion when you disobey God

        <p>
            2CH 18:1 That was a terrible mistake. After this Judah could not remain the same again. Intermarrying with the daughter of an idolater, prostitute and witch.
Athaliah, the wife of Jehoshaphat almost destroyed the seed of kingship through Judah and through which the Lord Jesus Christ would come. That would have been a fatal disaster for all of us and we would be damned but thank God he is always in control of things

        <p>
            2CH 11:16 In the face of adversity is the true content of a person revealed. It was during the division of these two kingdoms that the people who really wanted to seek God left their inheritance in Israel to live in Judah while others could not leave everything they own and would rather worship goat demons that Jeroboam the son of Nebat made.
Israel never remained the same again and this was just a beginning till they finally ended up in Babylon

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            2CH 10:7 There is something about kindness that makes people gladly obey you. Unfortunately Rehoboam the son of Solomon was begged to be kind to them and they will serve him forever but he rejected the counsel of the elders who had been with Solomon and took advice from the young men who had grown up with him.
Unfortunately, that was a disastrous decision and he lost control of 10 of the kingdoms because the people rebelled against him.

            1CH 13:10 God had commanded in Exodus 25:12-15 that the ark should be carried on poles through the four rings. The instruction was followed by the Israelites during the times of Moses and Aaron up until the Philistines captured it.
The Philistines did send it back on cows because they didn?t know better but they at least showed respect and God honoured it by allowing their guess [if the oxen went towards the land of Israel] to come to pass to show that it was him (God) who struck the Philistines with tumours.

Who can stand against the Lord of Host. Not even the devil or any witch, wizard, demon or occultist power can withstand such mighty force from the Lord.
