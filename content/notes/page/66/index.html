        <p>
            EXO 4:4 God was sending Moses to the Israelites but not without signs and wonders. He empowered Moses to do the undoable.
Moses ran away from the staff turned snake but God told him to take the snake by the tail. &lsquo;Who does that&rsquo;. God was directly telling him to confront his fears. God was saying &lsquo;i make the harmless deadly and the deadly harmless.
Second empowerment was turning a healthy hand to a diseased one and a diseased one to a healthy flesh.

EXO 25:8 THEY will make for GOD a sanctuary where he will dwell. Just as we are to offer our body a living sacrifice and it is a temple of the Holy Ghost but it needs to be according to God&rsquo;s word and specification
