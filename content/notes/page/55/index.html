        <p>
            2KI 11:2 Athaliah was even willing to kill her grandson. She was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel who were very wicked and served other gods.
She killed all the king&rsquo;s offspring except one (Joash) who was hid by Jehosheba the half-sister of king Joram father of Ahaziah. This was when Joash was some months old.
Joash became the youngest serving king of Judah while Athaliah became the first recorded woman to reign as king and as you know, her reign was disastrous because she took after her parents.

        <p>
            2KI 7:9 The Gospel must be preached. It is not good for us to eat of the goodness of the Lord Jesus without proclaiming it to the unsaved.
Some punishment will come to us if we just shut up and let people go to hell.
Although we are saved but people must also be saved. We must bear fruits so we will get rewards in heaven. Besides there is also joy when people get saved

            2KI 4:43 Miracle of multiplication of bread. Jesus performed the same thing after giving thanks to God. Elisha was instructed by the word of the Lord before he did it.
This type of miracle was seen in the ministry of Moses (Called to save Israelites from Egypt), Elisha (means God is salvation) and Jesus (Saviour of the world from sin. His name means saviour/salvation).

        <p>
            2KI 3:27 One of the reasons God forbid the ways of the heathen. Child sacrifice was part of it and they sacrificed these to demons.
God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac long ago, it may have been a common practice in the time of Abraham but Abraham was willing to do so not to a demon but to the true God because Hebrews 11 tells us that ABRAHAM BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD.

        <p>
            2KI 1:3 It was a disgrace to leave the king of kings and go enquiry from demons from a different nation. Getting himself ensnared and bringing upon himself punishment as God had previously warned not to have anything to do with the gods of other nations.
It is so sad many Christians of nowadays are in the same bondage and finds nothing wrong with them. In fact the occult has been so blended in daily lives that we see nothing wrong in it.
