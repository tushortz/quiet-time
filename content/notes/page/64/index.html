God is faithful but we are not receiving anything because of our disobedience or we are not playing our part of the covenant.
God is a relational God. He does nothing for man without man&rsquo;s consent.
Things God did
 gave them all the land (habitation) gave them rest (peace) handed all their enemies over to them (overcomer) fulfilled all part of his covenant  Related verses: JOSHUA 21:43-45.

            JOS 20:6 God has provided a way by right we must be saved from our sins. It is up to us to run to Jesus, our city of refuge. These city of refuge were only for those who committed murder unintentionally whether stranger or native Israelite. Since Jesus our high priest has offered the sacrifice of sins once and for all, we are discharged and acquitted indefinitely and since he ever liveth to make intercession for us, we are saved and forgiven of our sins.
