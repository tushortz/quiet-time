## EPH 6:11

On a sidenote: "We dishonour God by breaking the law" - Romans 3:23

The full armour of God is enough to protect us from the devil's attack.

- Belt of truth
- breastplate of righteousness
- shoes of the gospel of peace
- shield of faith - quench ALL fiery darts
- helmet of salvation
- sword of the spirit - word of God
- pray in the spirit

The devil's weapon is deception. Only the truth in Jesus and his word will save us.

- Our weapons are mighty

* Mention the name of Jesus
* Cover yourself with the blood of Jesus Christ
