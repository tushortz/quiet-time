## ECC 4:8

The soul is the entity that is judged and that which God requires. 

Life and accomplishments and labours without God is vain and useless. God has made sure that we human are dependent beings on him and we cause ourselves problems when we decide to revel against him and live our own lives.

It debased us to live like mere animals as we are without God.

**Related verses**: Ecclesiastes 4:8, Luke 12:16-21. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3478683761515422124)
