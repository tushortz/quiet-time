## ECC 2:8

Solomon started with tolerance of evil and this desensitized him until he disobeyed God and openly practised idolatry.

this is what the media is doing to make people think a lot of things that God is against us really normal

**Related verses**: Ecclesiastes 2:8. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3478662431835414764)
