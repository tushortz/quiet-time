## ECC 10:16

Why is it bad for a servant to be a ruler?
Why is it bad to feast in the morning?

Feasting in the morning is enjoying when there is work to be done. Feasts are usually done at night, drinking wine and making merry.

The morning is meant to be a productive day. If a servant is ruling then his subjects are servants of servants.

"Feasting at the right time and for strength not for pleasure/getting drunk".

The morning is to be productive. As a leader, tgey assembled in the city gates to do judgement and justice but when the ruler is drunk, he would pervert the cause of justice.

Bishop says many people do not prosper because they do not use the opportunities (time and chance) God gives them wisely.
