## ISA 58:5

Fasting is a means of humbling myself. It should also be a time to mourn for my sins and produce a repentant heart (poor in Spirit)

It looks like this fasting was done on the Sabbath because it was the only day that God did not permit work.

Fasting makes my voice heard. Fasting is not just about depriving the body of food even though it's a means of starving the flesh to stuff the Spirit.

Another type of fasting is to release the captives. To show compassion and mercy is better than fasting and sacrifices
