## ISA 37:10

First Sennacherib tries to discourage the people by telling them not to trust in their King Hezekiah because the enemy goes or the head. When he realised that Hezekiah was unmoved, then he tries to find the source of Hezekiah?s strength and when he realised his confidence was in God, he tries to persuade Hezekiah not to trust in God. 

Do not let Hezekiah deceive you ... (in chapter 36)
Do not let your God deceive you
