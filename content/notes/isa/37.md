## ISA 37:11

First Sennacherib tries to discourage the people by telling them not to trust in their King Hezekiah because the enemy goes or the head. When he realised that Hezekiah was unmoved, then he tries to find the source of Hezekiah?s strength and when he realised his confidence was in God, he tries to persuade Hezekiah not to trust in God. 

Do not let Hezekiah deceive you ... (in chapter 36)
Do not let your God deceive you

## ISA 37:16

The scroll was addressed and given by the almighty father to the person who had authority to open it but no one in all creation had the authority to open the sealed scroll but once was found which was Jesus proving his divinity.

The four living creatures are the four cherubims of God's glory who carries his throne. God sits on his throne and the ark being his footstool and represents his presence.

The earth also represents God's footstool
