## ISA 14:11

Sheol (Hades) or the place of the dead is below the earth according to spiritual geography. It shows that when men die they go down immediately. Jesus also died and went to hell because the scripture says that he went and preached to the dead. 

Lazarus and the rich man was also in hell. The difference is that Lazarus was in paradise whereas the rich man was in hell. The two are just different locations in the same place. 

A gulf separates both Hell and Abraham's Bossom and during resurrection, the righteous resurrects and ascend and the unrighteous remain in hell.

And when hell is out in the lake of fire, they are also automatically put into the lake of fire
