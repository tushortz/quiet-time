## ISA 26:3

There is peace and there is perfect peace. This can only be given by the prince of peace. 

Thesaurus defines peace as freedom of the mind from annoyance, distraction, anxiety, obsession etc.

We can only achieve perfect peace when our mind is focused on Jesus and not of the things of the world. There is always tribulation in the world. We live in a fast paced world that tries us out but focusing on Jesus helps us to discard unnecessary problems that can occur with a mind focused on the world, its fleeting pleasures, fame and glory.

Only Jesus gives true peace of mind. As a matter of fact peace of mind is better than fame, money or pleasure. If all these actually give true peace, then you should ask many celebrities who look glamorous on the outside. They smile and look 5 star but when you dig deeper, you see that they are nothing but broken bottles. They fake a smile but they don?t have peace of mind.

We try to copy these people but it only results in the same depression, oppression, anger, jealously and some venture into drugs and never find the path of life.

Jesus says I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. no one comes to the father but by me.

Have you surrendered your life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ or are still seeking smoke?
