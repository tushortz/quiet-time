## MRK 5:27

Faith of the woman with the issue of blood
This woman had heard a lot about Jesus which made her increase in faith. For faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. - Romans 10:17

The woman had been unclean more than 12 years. Anyone she touched remained unclean except they wash. She had been isolated, ostracised, couldn't move publicly. 

She was bankrupt, in pains, in sorrow. She was a woman. Woman are very emotional and her condition worsened. Finally she could bear it no longer and out of desperation she walked into the crowd not caring about who she would make unclean.

She thought, if only I could touch the hem of his garment I will be made whole
