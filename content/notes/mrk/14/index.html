<p>When I obey my leader, I will find it as he has said. It makes my life easy</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Mark 14:16. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3337821711953028030">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mrk-148">MRK 14:8</h2>
<p>Either Mary Magdalene knew what she was doing or was moved by the Holy Spirit to do it but Jesus knew it was something that needed to be done.</p>
<p>She spent almost a year worth of wages to purchase the perfume. That probably was her savings.</p>
<p>?To whom much is forgiven, the same loves much?</p>
<p>When I realise how much I?ve been forgiven, it will help me love God even more.</p>
<p>She loves Jesus so much and was probably fulfilling Songs 1:12-13</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Song of Solomon 1:12-13, Mark 14:8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3335686244214235376">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mrk-1411">MRK 14:11</h2>
<p>A lover of money is a dangerous person</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Mark 14:11, 1 Timothy 6:10. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3335499974963880335">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mrk-1438">MRK 14:38</h2>
<p>Prayer is the antidote to temptation and a weak flesh.</p>
<p>When the spirit is developed, it takes over from the flesh otherwise the flesh takes over.</p>
<p>This is why Jesus had a lifestyle of prayer.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MARK 14:38. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2888364771072795534">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mrk-1425">MRK 14:25</h2>
<p>There will be drinks in the kingdom of God on the great feast where we will see Abraham, a Isaac, Jacob and the saints of old and the apostles and the Lord himself</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MARK 14:25. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2888363061340267397">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mrk-149">MRK 14:9</h2>
<p>Mary the sister of Martha and Lazarus gained a memorial in the scriptures because of her acts of love and devotion to Christ.</p>
<p>300 denarii was almost a year?s wages. The typical wage of a labourer was a denarius per day. In modern times, it would cost around ?19,500.</p>
<p>That was a very expensive perfume indeed. Judas must have thought,</p>
<p>?omg, did you just see that, if we share that money between each other and Jesus gets 25%, mehn, Peter, you don?t need to go fishing in a month?s time, we will be cruising on horse back?</p>
<p>But that was not the way it was intended. God had different plans but unfortunately, Judas made himself available to be used as an instrument for evil just for his greed</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MARK 14:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2888359312655901555">notes</a></p>
