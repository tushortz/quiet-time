## MRK 1:3

God is calling Jesus Lord here showing that Jesus has a higher status. Isaiah 40:3 explains better saying prepare the way for our God.

## MRK 1:25

After Jesus had taught the sermons in Matthew 7, the unclean spirit in a man cried out. The demon in the man was able to identify Jesus. (Familiar Spirit)

"Have you come to destroy us before the time". There were more than one demon in this man but only one possessed him. When Jesus cast him out, all the others followed but the man was thrown into convulsion first

Jesus didn't have a conversation with the demon (unclean spirits), he just cast him out
