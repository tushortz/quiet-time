## MRK 12:36

Jesus has been put in the place of adminstration until Satan is put under his feet. Then everything will then be committed back to the Father.

David spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit about the son which happened when he ressurected and the Holy Spirit (the rod of his sceptre) was sent down to earth on the day of judgement.

## MRK 12:25

There is no reproduction in heaven. Angels don't marry. When they rise from the dead? We know that not everyone has risen from the dead except for Jesus because everyone else who was raised from the dead died again. We are still awaiting our ressurected body.

This means that all dead people are still somewhere but not in heaven. Probably Hades but in the part of paradise awaiting ressurection.

## MRK 12:24

Knowledge is vital to prevent from error. Knowledge of the scriptures and knowledge of the power of God

**Related verses**: Mark 12:24. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3595187837987447179)


## MRK 12:16

The denarius belonged to Tiberius Ceasar so it had Ceasar's image and inscription. I was made in God's image so I belong to God and must give myself to him just as the golden coin was given to Ceasar as a sign of his ownership and authority.

There is nothing wrong about paying due respect to those in authority as long as it doesn't contradict the word of God.
