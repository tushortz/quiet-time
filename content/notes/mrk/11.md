## MRK 11:16

Carrying wares and using the temple area as a shortcut was irreverence and Jesus took serious action against it. They were using the area reserved for gentiles worship to shortcut between the mount of olives and Jerusalem.

?My house shall be called of ALL NATIONS? a house of prayer. This includes the gentiles and worshipping for the gentiles was made difficult. The house of God had been made a marketplace.

As the body of Christ, we cannot use him or his people to shortcut our way to achieve what we want
