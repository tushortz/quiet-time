## MRK 7:7

The scriptures carry more weight and references than any tradition that could ever be. Unfortunately, one problem plaguing Christianity is giving it man-made traditions equal value to the scriptures or even more value. This can be seen in a lot of Christian sects. This nullify the word of God and renders it less-effective

**Related verses**: Mark 7:7. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3325541973372953413)
