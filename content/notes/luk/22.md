## LUK 22:31

The threshing wheel separates the chaff from the wheat by subjecting the grain to pressure when it is treaded on by both the wheels and the cow threshing the grain.

Satan petitioned God to have Job sifted like wheat but Job's faith did not fail. Satan demanded that Peter would be tested as well but his faith did not fail even when he denied Jesus and went back to fishing. This is because Jesus had interceded for him. Jesus did not stop Satan's request but merely prayed that his faith will not fail
