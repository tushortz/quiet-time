## LUK 7:46

Simon didn't give Jesus the proper treatment of a guest yet he had the guts to critically analyse Jesus and the immoral woman.

The woman heard about Jesus and made her way there with a very expensive perfume and gave Jesus the proper treatment of a guest.

I must not criticise men of God and must give them the proper treatment. The woman left with the joy that her sins had been forgiven.
