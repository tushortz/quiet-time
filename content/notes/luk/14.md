## LUK 14:27

You can't love anyone more than yourself naturally that's why Jesus said love your NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.

the most important person I need to lose is MYSELF. Ministry is work and God pays for our services.

he has already paid me through the blood of his son Jesus.

- PUT GOD FIRST. 
- GIVE YOUR TIME AND EFFORT

pride is putting yourself first.
