## LUK 12:25

Jesus calls adding one hour of lifespan a very little thing. If I can't do this little thing then why worry. I might as well trust him

## LUK 12:24

I am more valuable and handsome in God?s sight. God cares so much about me. He loves me so much.

How can an awesome God love a wretch like me. This live story is too wonderful for me to understand.


My love my king
I?m mesmerised by your love
You took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon a rock

How marvellous are your works oh God
Your wisdom is perfect
