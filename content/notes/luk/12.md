## LUK 12:17

The soul is the entity that is judged and that which God requires. 

Life and accomplishments and labours without God is vain and useless. God has made sure that we human are dependent beings on him and we cause ourselves problems when we decide to revel against him and live our own lives.

It debased us to live like mere animals as we are without God.

## LUK 12:26

Jesus calls adding one hour of lifespan a very little thing. If I can't do this little thing then why worry. I might as well trust him

## LUK 12:24

I am more valuable and handsome in God?s sight. God cares so much about me. He loves me so much.

How can an awesome God love a wretch like me. This live story is too wonderful for me to understand.


My love my king
I?m mesmerised by your love
You took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon a rock

How marvellous are your works oh God
Your wisdom is perfect
