## LUK 20:4

Baptism is an agreement and outward sign and public declaration of an inner change of mind and heart. Because it is public, it is visible to the public and humbling because people will see you and will know you agree that you are a sinner.

it took humility to be baptised. Christ was humble enough to get baptised. John was baptised from heaven (ordained by God. he was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth). Baptist wasn't new. the Jews knew about ritual purification already. only that John's baptism was the real manifestation of what the priests in old testament did. it was a sign of washing for forgiveness of sins but all things in the old testament was a type and shadow of what is to come.

In Leviticus, Spiritual Holiness was symbolised by physical perfection. In the new testament it was a transition from the outer cleanliness to inner purity.

Only those who truly repent receives the Holy Spirit who then makes them pure but those who refuse to repent faces wrath and judgement.

the water cleanses (from sin) but the fire purifies from impurities. Can I stand water and fire.
