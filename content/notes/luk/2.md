## LUK 2:23

I believe the parents of Jesus were poor. The law said anyone who couldn't afford a lamb to redeem the first son that opens the womb should offer a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeon (Leviticus 12:8) and that's exactly what the parents of Jesus did.  Luke 2:24, 

The king of Kings was born among poor parents.

## LUK 2:7

Jesus birth in a manger signifies the disguise of humility. 

Learn to be humble. Learn humility from the Lord Jesus

Matthew 11:28-30 - Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.?Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
