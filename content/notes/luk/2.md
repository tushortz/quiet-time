## LUK 2:23

I believe the parents of Jesus were poor. The law said anyone who couldn't afford a lamb to redeem the first son that opens the womb should offer a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeon (Leviticus 12:8) and that's exactly what the parents of Jesus did.  Luke 2:24, 

The king of Kings was born among poor parents.
