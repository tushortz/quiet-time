<p>That was an indirect insult to Jesus that he didn?t teach his disciples well and also since he was an irresponsible party goer it was clear that his disciples would be the same as well as his circles of sinners</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Luke 5:33. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3351788239949914555">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="luk-530">LUK 5:30</h2>
<p>The good thing is that Jesus was thinking and not just blinded by religious dos and don?t. Unfortunately many Christians stopped using their brains when it comes to the issue of faith. Faith isn?t setting aside the brain. Religion corrodes the mental faculty.</p>
<p>It was also an insult to pick on Jesus when he was being honoured by Matthew with a party at his home. The Pharisees were not humble nor have a teachable spirit.</p>
<p>God help me not to be unyielding and unteachable.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Luke 5:29-31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3351787115423457702">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="luk-513">LUK 5:13</h2>
<p>Jesus was willing and laid hands on the leprous man</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Luke 5:13. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3350223612531172319">notes</a></p>
