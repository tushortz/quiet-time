## JHN 1:2

1. The word of a person are what we hear as they speak, the sound that comes from their mouth as they speak. This is a glimpse of a physical representation of the relation between Christ Jesus and our Heavenly Father as they are in the spiritual realm.

## JHN 1:32

The baptism was a way to identify Jesus as the messiah. Whoever the Holy Spirit falls and remains upon was the sign to be used to identify the messiah. 
Everyone was definitely a sinner who came to be baptised as a sign of repentance so the Holy Spirit could not fall on sinners just like the dove would not find a place to rest her feet when Noah sent it out of the ark.

Because Jesus was the only sinless person, the Holy Spirit could rest on him

## JHN 1:48

Jesus was from Nazareth in Galilee. Peter, Andrew and Philip were from Bethsaida in Galilee. Although Andrew met Jesus in Bethabara beyond Jordan. The two disciples of John came and stayed with Jesus till the next day. 

It seemed as though Jesus went to visit Andrew in Galilee and there Andrew showed Peter to Jesus. Or perhaps Jesus went to see John again and there he met Philip and told him to follow him
