## JHN 10:10

The true state of a shepherd-sheep relationship. The real shepherd interceded on behalf of the sheep while the other sought to destroy the life of the child as she destroyed the life of her son.

The thief comes to kill, steal and destroy. Jesus came that we may have life.

The word of God is important in discerning good and wise judgement.

this is what happens when Satan brings an accusation before the father but Jesus or his followers petitions the father so that they might not be given over to the will of Satan the evil one
