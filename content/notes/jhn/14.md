## JHN 14:26

A good shepherd causes fear to disappear in the life of the sheep because they can confidently trust in him to lead them safely. He comforts them (The Holy ghost, the comforter)

The Holy Spirit is our teacher (who leads), comforter (whose rod protects) and whose staff (teaches and guides) us. The Holy Spirit is a great shepherd
