## JHN 14:26

A good shepherd causes fear to disappear in the life of the sheep because they can confidently trust in him to lead them safely. He comforts them (The Holy ghost, the comforter)

The Holy Spirit is our teacher (who leads), comforter (whose rod protects) and whose staff (teaches and guides) us. The Holy Spirit is a great shepherd

## JHN 14:23

The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me. 

I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that's another level.

Jesus already promised he's with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.

Obeying Jesus words confers upon me divine wisdom because of his saying in Matthew 7:24 of the two house builders and their foundation.
