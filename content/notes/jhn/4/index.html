<p>In God&rsquo;s light our eyes are clear to behold light itself. God&rsquo;s light gives us illumination</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Psalms 36:9, John 4:10, John 4:14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3430019375653707887">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jhn-436">JHN 4:36</h2>
<ul>
<li>Doing the will of the father is God&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t think you have long time. Do it now.  Don&rsquo;t delay your blessings.</li>
<li>The grace of God had power to do anything (only in the church can a somebody kneel down to a nobody to lay hands on them)</li>
<li>Young people can be encouraged to do so much</li>
<li>Part of church blessings is that you have friends</li>
<li>Obedience is the key</li>
<li>God uses people from a early age no matter who you are.  (Samuel,  David, Isaac)</li>
<li>Work for God as a young person</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t make profit in the house of God.  Don&rsquo;t have that mind.  But you can receive wages</li>
</ul>
<p>John 1:12 -  Bur as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name</p>
<ul>
<li>See God as someone who wants to give a reward</li>
<li>Have a positive mind of doing the work of God otherwise your effort isn&rsquo;t worth it</li>
<li>You will never serve God in vain.  Do things not with people in mind but with God in mind</li>
<li>You will be the first partaker of the fruit if you serve God</li>
</ul>
<p>You will receive wages for:
&ndash; matthew 6:33 -  Seek ye first the kingdom of God</p>
<p>You have all the needed basic amenities of life according to economics.  Food,  shelter and clothing.  The rest are wants</p>
<ul>
<li>Your wages come in the form of deliverance from shame,  deliverance and embarrassment</li>
</ul>
<p>Your worth increases when you obey what you have been told to do. (Jesus mother said to the men at the wedding,  do whatever he tells you to do)</p>
<ul>
<li>Bishop Dag Heward Mills</li>
</ul>
<p>God does things in order.  He performs great things in order. Jesus had to tell the disciples to arrange the people in order before he performed the miracle of multiplying 5 loaves and 2 fishes</p>
