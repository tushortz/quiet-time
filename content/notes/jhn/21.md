## JHN 21:11

They had toiled al night to catch a single fish but at one command from Jesus and obedience, they caught more than they were able to carry.

It was until Jesus appeared and spoke that miracles happened. It wasn?t just fishes but large fishes. He also prepared food for them before they reached shore.

Jesus was feeding them just as he would tell Simon Peter John soon to feed his sheep
