## JHN 3:17

God has always given man a second chance before initiating a final judgement as we can see in the times of Noah, the Judges, Lot etc.

God needs a witness before he can initiate a judgement that's why Abraham, Noah and other examples had to agree with God and preach the gospel.

Another reason why Jesus had to be born of man was not just to save us of our sin but was also so that he could be a human witness of the final judgement.

Our salvation is dependent on our obedience because our obedience is linked to our hearing and this is why God constantly warned the Israelites to hearken to his words and that involves doing. To hear is easy but to do is hard but the doing is what confirms our faith
