## JHN 9:14

The sabbath was a day of rest not a day of burdens. A day of freedom not a day of religious exercise.

Jesus freed the man on sabbath as much as he did miracles most of the time on the sabbath.

Jesus himself is our sabbath. 

?Come to me all that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest?
