<p>I believe this Psalm was written when he fled from his son Absalom. His trusted friend and counsellor &ldquo;Ahithophel&rdquo; had connived with Absalom in his rebellion. Ahithophel&rsquo;s motive may have been because David slept with his grand daughter &ldquo;BathSheba&rdquo; and had his son&rsquo;s son-in-law Uriah killed in battle.</p>
<p>In those days, Ahithophel&rsquo;s counsel was such that it was likened to when one inquired at the oracles of God (2 Samuel 16:23).</p>
<p>David fled his throne at this rebellion and prayed that Ahithophel&rsquo;s counsel be turned into foolishness. Ahithophel&rsquo;s gave Absalom good counsel on how to get rid of David(The Lord&rsquo;s anointed) forever and he asked to be given 12,000 men to kill David.</p>
<p>Fortunately for David, his friend turned betrayer committed suicide(hanged himself) after his counsel was rejected although it was first thought a wise decision but God overthrew his wise counsel.</p>
<p>There is double fulfilment here as compared to Jesus. Judas Iscariot is the Ahithophel of the New Testament who betrayed Jesus and committed suicide. (John 13:18)</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many friends have turned into betrayers. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many enemies are against you whether it be 12,000 chosen by an Ahithophel or 6,000 chosen by a Saul. As long as God is for you &hellip;&hellip; Who can be against you? (You can answer that)</p>
