## JHN 12:26

If I faithfully serve Jesus, the father will honour me

**Related verses**: John 12:26. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3328507497321062861)


## JHN 12:11

They were expecting the Messiah yet were so obsessed with the teaching and traditions of the elders. They valued the oral changing traditions of the dead elders to the written unchanging word of the living God.

**Related verses**: John 12:11. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3328463503190909071)


## JHN 12:10

The chief priests must be possessed to think of killing someone even though the scriptures says THOU SHALL NOT MURDER.

They knew the law but didn?t live the law

**Related verses**: John 12:10. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3328460272209485899)


## JHN 12:5

1 denarius was a day?s wage. In today?s value assuming working 8 hours a day (which would be probably even more) will probably be around 

300 days x ?8 x 8 hours = ?19,200

Probably equivalent of a Rolls Royce, Lamborghini, Ford or some very expensive item.

If this was done for Jesus in this day and age, he will he accused as a false prophet. Lord have mercy on us.

We can?t equate Jesus with the poor. He is the king of kings. He said we will always have the poor with us.

It is evil to prevent or be angry when a man of God is being honoured.

**Related verses**: John 12:5. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3328456973674602544)
