## JOS 10:25

The Lord has put his feet on the neck of our enemies.

This reminds me of Psalm 110:1 - the Lord says to my Lord, sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies at your feet. Jesus is sitting with the father and until the church which is the body of Christ trample Satan under our feet. Jesus has already won the victory and now we need to enforce it.

## JOS 10:24

Out of all the men of Israel, only the COMMANDERS of the MEN OF WAR WHO WENT WITH JOSHUA were given the privilege to put their feet on the beck of the five kings.

You need to be actively participating in combat with evil forces and then have the privilege to put your feet on the neck of kings. The others were just there to watch and clap
