## JOS 21:44

God fulfilled all his promises from the time of Abraham even until Joshua. 

God is faithful but we are not receiving anything because of our disobedience or we are not playing our part of the covenant.

God is a relational God. He does nothing for man without man's consent.

Things God did
- gave them all the land (habitation)
- gave them rest (peace)
- handed all their enemies over to them (overcomer)
- fulfilled all part of his covenant
