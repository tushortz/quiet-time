<p>In the prostitute&rsquo;s house was a woman.</p>
<p>Who can fathom the wonderful works of God
Who can understand his thought
For he stands high and mighty
A king above shall the earth</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: JOSHUA 6:22. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2570211319475855573">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jos-617">JOS 6:17</h2>
<p>She was allowed to live because she protected the messengers of God and she reaped a good reward through her faith having heard all that God had done.</p>
<p>Her faith was based on doing something after she had heard about the wonders of God</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: JOSHUA 6:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2570210289606451402">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jos-625">JOS 6:25</h2>
<p>Rahab was saved because she was merciful, had faith in God and now she was repeating her fruit of labour. Even though she was a prostitute, she still was saved and was in the faith&rsquo;s all of fame.</p>
<p>Without faith it is impossible to please God. She was more preferred than the faithless armed men of Israel who all died in the wilderness after leaving Egypt</p>
