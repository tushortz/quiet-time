## JOS 5:9

Named after the new generations were circumcised removing the foreskin of their private part. A removal of the old and an appearance of the new.

This involved shedding of blood. The Old Testament also involved shedding of blood.

Removing the old self and putting on a new self. Old things have passed away. All things become new.

Circumcision also means: May it be done to you as this foreskin (cut off from the rest) if you do not obey the commandments of God

## JOS 5:6

All the men of war of Israel died in the wilderness during the 40 years because THEY DID NOT listen to the voice of God.

As a result of disobedience, their uncircumcised sons replaced them. The youngest of these sons born after they had departed Egypt must now be around 40+ years
