## JOS 12:1

31 kings in all had to be defeated before Israel got to the promised land. What are the 31 kings in your life that needs to be destroyed? 

It took years but Joshua was obedient and didn't give up until they had taken the promised land.

Don't give up, keep seeking after God. Don't give up
