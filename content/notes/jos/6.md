In the prostitute's house was a woman.

Who can fathom the wonderful works of God
Who can understand his thought
For he stands high and mighty
A king above shall the earth

## JOS 6:17

She was allowed to live because she protected the messengers of God and she reaped a good reward through her faith having heard all that God had done.

Her faith was based on doing something after she had heard about the wonders of God

## JOS 6:25

Rahab was saved because she was merciful, had faith in God and now she was repeating her fruit of labour. Even though she was a prostitute, she still was saved and was in the faith's all of fame.

Without faith it is impossible to please God. She was more preferred than the faithless armed men of Israel who all died in the wilderness after leaving Egypt
