## JOS 22:11

Beware of assumptions. Don't act on it. 

How to prevent problems assumptions could cause
- They sent a priest (intercessor)
- 11 elders (men capable of making wise judgements)
- called the opposing party
- Explained their opinion and gave the opposing team chance to talk as well
- case understood, matters settled, case dismissed
- no war


Assumptions could have caused a trivial or national war because the Reubenites, Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh and the rest of Israel because these three tribes fought for their brothers until they possessed the land ad now assumptions could have lead to war.

It is also good that the 9 1/2 parts of Israel stood to fight to prevent further destruction of their people.

In conclusion, the best way to settle s matter is to first discuss the matter
