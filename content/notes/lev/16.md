## LEV 16:2

the purpose of the incense and the fire was to create a cloud of smoke which would then cover the mercy seat so that the high priest would not come into direct eye contact with God when he sprinkles the blood on the mercy seat. this is because the glory of God will be manifested

## LEV 16:15

The High priest was to offer two sacrifices on the day of atonement. the 10th day of the 7th months.

The first sacrifice for himself and his household and the second for the congregation (Israelites).

he needed to enter the Holy of Holies twice to do that.

With Jesus our great high priest, because he was sinless, he didn't need to offer atonement for himself. So he only needed to offer atonement for us the spiritual Israelites (congregation). For this reason, he only needed to offer the atonement once and for all.
