## PHP 2:5

SELFISH 
Manifesting concern for oneself

IMPRESS
To affect strongly in mind and feelings

HUMBLE
Low in rank, status or importance


Always think others are better than me. Never my interest.

Others are my interest.

Christ as an example
- Giving up your privilege (special rights)
- Humble position of a slave
- Humble himself in obedience to God


- Elevated to the highest place of honour
- Given a name above every other
- Jesus is Lord
