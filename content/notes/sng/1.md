## SNG 1:13

Either Mary Magdalene knew what she was doing or was moved by the Holy Spirit to do it but Jesus knew it was something that needed to be done.

She spent almost a year worth of wages to purchase the perfume. That probably was her savings.

?To whom much is forgiven, the same loves much?

When I realise how much I?ve been forgiven, it will help me love God even more.

She loves Jesus so much and was probably fulfilling Songs 1:12-13
