## SNG 2:5

Lord let me be sick for your love. let me become addicted to your love. They say love us blind, blind me to everything but you Jesus. May I be possessed with your being. overcome my desire for anything but you

**Related verses**: Song of Solomon 2:5. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3476850175585805085)


## SNG 2:2

Jesus my lily among the thorns. the one that blossoms when everything around is dead. the one who shines in the dark. the one who glows when everything looks bleak. his smile is contagious, his words like oil soothes my soul.

his touch arouses a sensation within me. I'm captivated by his love. I'm bound by his demeanor. I'm held by the shakles of his heart.

Lord let my desire be for you. Let my soul be bound to you. May I become an addict of your presence.
