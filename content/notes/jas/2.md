## JAS 2:24

It is faith in Jesus that saves us and not works. Valid faith is shown through works that is why every faith must be accompanied by evidence.

... For faith is the evidence of things not seen

If we claim to be a believer saved by Jesus sacrifice on the cross and no one sees any evidence of a change in us, then our faith is fake.

Claiming to have faith without corresponding action in dead. We are saved for good works (Ephesians 2:10) but not by good works (Ephesians 2:8)
