## JON 1:6

It is amazing that it was the unbeliever captain that went to tell Jonah to stay awake and call on his God. Many tines, we neglect our duty as Christians and it takes the unbelievers to awake us from our slumber.

The unbelievers even though they don?t believe in God, they can tell from your actions if you are truly a Christian because they expect a certain standard from you and if you are short of it, why will they believe in your God.

But Jonah couldn?t call on hisGod because he had sinned by disobeying God and that was why he was running away.

## JON 1:3

Jonah didn?t have enough revelation of God to know that God is omnipresent. He even paid a fair to run away from God.
