<h2 id="1co-135-1">1CO 13:5</h2>
<p>When Samuel was old, he appointed his two sons to be judges in Beersheba but they didn&rsquo;t walk in the ways of God. They were corrupt so the elders of Israel demanded for a King. Not just a King but LIKE THE OTHER NATIONS.</p>
<p>Have they forgotten that God took them away from Egypt and separated them from the other nations so that they will be a model for the other nations but now they wanted it the other way round.</p>
<p>Samuel felt rejected and consulted God and God decided to grant their requests but warned them of the repercussion of doing so. (1 Samuel 8:-18) but they still ignored the repercussion and went ahead</p>
<p>Initially God had prophesied about 400 years ago about giving them a King (Deuteronomy 17:14-15) but they asked too soon and with the wrong motive.</p>
<p>I believe David was the one God was preparing to give the people and it would take about 20-25 more years as David was not yet ready for a kingship role and was still undergoing training in the wilderness taking care of the sheep.</p>
<p>Since God loves Israel even though they have rejected him and are still rebelling against him, he decided to grant their requests since &ldquo;Love does not insist on its own ways (1 Corinthians 13:5)</p>
<p>Also to teach them that they don&rsquo;t know anything about Kingship and that their decision without God will only be catastrophic. At least they will also learn their lesson. God doesn&rsquo;t force. He gives you the plan, he gives you an option to choose to obey or disobey. Obedience may not always be easy and easy to understand but it&rsquo;s worth it whereas disobedience will be costly.</p>
<p>So God found Saul, although not the best choice God wanted to give them but he gave them someone who had traits of the main one.</p>
<p>Lesson</p>
<ul>
<li>Be yourself, don&rsquo;t copy others if it&rsquo;s for personal gain</li>
<li>Rely on God to make the decisions</li>
<li>Be patient, don&rsquo;t rush so that God can give you the best. Don&rsquo;t rush to get a counterfeit</li>
<li>Always heed to warning</li>
<li>in-spite of sorrows, be patient and wait on God</li>
<li>Accept the person God has placed in your life in-spite of circumstances</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be wise in your own ways. God has better plans for us and since we can&rsquo;t see the big picture, we think it doesn&rsquo;t make sense so we try to fit in something else and often we disrupt God&rsquo;s plan for us</li>
</ul>
