## 1CO 9:27

Be careful with your body and its desires. You are not a superman. You are still a man living in a corrupt body. Renew your mind with the word of God constantly and forget about your desires otherwise you will be brought down.

Forget about your feelings. Focus on the work of God. The time is short.
