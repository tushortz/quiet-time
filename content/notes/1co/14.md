Tongues is more useful for personal development and spiritual growth whereas prophecy is leaned towards the body of Christ. 

It is greater to edify the body of Christ than oneself though both are necessary and important.

## 1CO 14:31

We are instructed to pursue Love at all cost yet desire and grow spiritual gifts but give prophecy the highest priority. We are to strive to use spiritual gifts in a way that it will edify the church

It makes mentions of two different types of tongues here: Unknown and strange tongues

Unknown tongues
- speaks to God not people
- unintelligible, no one understands him
- speaks mysteries by the spirit
- Paul wish we all speak in unknown tongues
- needs interpretation to be equal with prophecy
-  many types of unknown tongues but each has its own meaning
- pray for power to interpret and explain it
- Mind is unproductive 
- helps nobody without interpretation 
- can give thanks, pray and sing with unknown tongues
- meant for a supernatural sign for unbelievers
- not advisable for all to speak in unknown tongues together
- not to be forbidden


Strange tongue
- edifies oneself
- Paul spoke in strange tongues more than everyone
- Better say intelligible words in public to instruct than speak in strange language 
- prophecy about God speaking to his people by the lips of foreigners - Isaiah 28,11-12
- has an interpretation 
- limited to two or three and each one taking turns and one interpret otherwise keep silent
 



Prophecy 
- we should give it high priority above other gift 
- spoken for edification (promote spiritual growth)
- encouragement, comfort and advise 
- Paul wish more that we prophecy
- more useful than speaking in unknown tongues
- prophecy for believers 
- acceptable for all to prophecy unlike unknown tongues
- can reveal an unbeliever's sin, reprove, convict and make him worship God
- needs others to judge prophecy



Let everything be constructive, orderly and edifying for the good of all
