## ACT 2:2

They 120 were probably in the temple and not the upper room as explained from the NASB study Bible.

Reference to Luke 24:53 where it was said that after Jesus ascension, the disciples all returned to Jerusalem and were continually in the temple.

This explains why about 5000 souls were saved on that day. There was a lot of people (probably around 100,000 to 120,000 more or less) who visited Jerusalem as It was the 50th day after passover and many of the Jews and converts came from all over for the feast and would most likely have been worshipping in the temple at 9AM 

The Holy spirit came in form of wind and fire on the day of Pentecost.

Wind to separate the chaff from the wheat and fire to burn off the chaff just as John the Baptist had predicted in Matthew 3:11-13
