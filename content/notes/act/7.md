## ACT 7:33

To take off one?s shoe is to show respect and humility. Slaves in old times didn?t wear sandals. Only their masters did and the slaves were required to stoop down to untie the master?s sandals. In so doing.

In so doing the slave is left in a humble position because of his posture. In two instances I.e. Moses and Joshua when they were required to take off their sandals because they were on Holy ground (in the presence of the living God).

In this way they had to bow and show reverence to the living God.

Even today in eastern religions like Islam for example, they still take off their sandals before going into the mosque.

We must always come in the presence of God with worship and reverence. We must take off our sandals (a symbol of our status and position) and show reverence to God.

Sandals are also a symbol of our sins because we walk with them and they take all the dirt. Taking off ones sandals is taking off what dirt (sin) is clinging to us.
