## ACT 4:3

Just after they had received the Holy Spirit and Peter had won 3000 souls, a lame man has also been healed and Peter and John had their first recorded prison experience.

It is inevitable to walk in Jesus anointing and not be persecuted. Jesus had warned previously that if they can do that to the master, the disciples should get ready to experience the same.
