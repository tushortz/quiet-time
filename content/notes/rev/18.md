## REV 18:5

Babylon was once great 


(Babylon was handsome, he had 6 packs, he was built. He had muscles But he fell and is now the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birds.)

If you have multiple sexual partners, you will become the habitation of Devils.


When you have sexual demons enter you, you become disobedient, licentious, rebellious.
