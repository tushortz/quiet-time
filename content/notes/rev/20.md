## REV 20:12

There is no reproduction in heaven. Angels don't marry. When they rise from the dead? We know that not everyone has risen from the dead except for Jesus because everyone else who was raised from the dead died again. We are still awaiting our ressurected body.

This means that all dead people are still somewhere but not in heaven. Probably Hades but in the part of paradise awaiting ressurection.

**Related verses**: Mark 12:25, Revelation 20:12-13. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3595191583735800231)


## REV 20:13

Does that mean some dead people are still in the sea and didn't go to hell or maybe these are the ones that died when fighting against Jesus or are there sea creatures whose end is in the sea like mermaids etc who are hybrids. Me I don't know

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:13. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655224751930728497)


## REV 20:12

The dead ones that were judged are the ones who have not yet received a resurrected body. This one does not apply to believers because they had accepted Jesus as their lord and saviour and had faced a different judgement based on works

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:12. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655220949139842047)


## REV 20:10

Don't be a partaker of evil. The devil who instigated the antichrist and false prophet was hurled in the lake of fire more than a 1000 years after them.

Most times the deceived suffer longer than the deceiver

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:10. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655219336648057846)


## REV 20:9

Now everyone who had not yet died has now died. Then the real judgement of everyone's works will now begin

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:9. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655216795319264227)


## REV 20:8

Life will still remain on earth and Satan will be present to deceive the descendants of the non-believing people of the time. How sad will it be that even when Jesus is reigning on earth some people still have the guts to be deceived and not believe

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:8. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655209914454500251)


## REV 20:4

The first resurrection. There were two groups of people on earth. The resurrected ones who died before the tribulation and the ones who were still on earth after the tribulation but without a resurrected body

**Related verses**: Revelation 20:4. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3655207105050960765)
