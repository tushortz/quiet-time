## REV 20:12

There is no reproduction in heaven. Angels don't marry. When they rise from the dead? We know that not everyone has risen from the dead except for Jesus because everyone else who was raised from the dead died again. We are still awaiting our ressurected body.

This means that all dead people are still somewhere but not in heaven. Probably Hades but in the part of paradise awaiting ressurection.

**Related verses**: Mark 12:25, Revelation 20:12-13. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3595191583735800231)
