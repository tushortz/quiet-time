## 1TI 2:15

The message version of this verse best explains it.

I have been wondering what apostle Paul was saying but i now I know that after Eve fell from transgression, she also got us the opportunity to be saved through childbearing which happened because a woman also gave birth to a saviour. Although the means of redemption has been provided, everyone still has the responsibility to work out their salvation through faith, love and holiness.

## 1TI 2:12

As I read, In ancient Israel, it was the responsibility of the mother to teach their daughters in religious education.

The father was responsible for teaching their son in every aspect of education. Apostle Paul may be following the trend of his day.
