## 1CH 29:9

There is this sense of joy that comes when you give to someone without compulsion but the joy is greater when it is to the things of God. Unfortunately, we would rather give to charity than to the house of God. It is always a controversy when the Pastor God has placed over you demands offerings and tithes.

Normally, they shouldn?t even do these things because as a normal Christian, it is our duty to do them. Arguments over these things only show your depths of spirituality and your knowledge of and love for God.
