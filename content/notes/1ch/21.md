## 1CH 21:18

This verse mentions that David purchased the site for 600 shekels of silver whereas 2 Samuel 24:24 mentions that David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen For 50 shekels of silver.

It may be that the threshing floor was a small portion of the whole site and that can account for the difference in price. 

It was at this site (on Mount Moriah) that Solomon built the temple. It may be this site that Abraham was told to sacrifice his son Isaac. (Although the bible only said Isaac was to be sacrificed on one of the mountains of Moriah).
