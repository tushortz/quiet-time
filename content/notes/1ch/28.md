## 1CH 28:9

This is a serious matter. This must be why Saul was rejected forever. God requires that we seek him first. We do the seeking before we find him.

The fearful part is to abandon God and he rejects us forever. We need to serve him with a blameless heart and a willing mind. There is nothing to hide from God anyway because he searches all hearts and minds and understands every intents and inclinations of our thoughts.
