<p>But Solomon went there to sacrifice to God finally and built the temple of God. It was here that Solomon received divine wisdom</p>

<p>In the spiritual realm, angels can also draw sword and sheath. Most things we have on earth probably already exist in the spirit realm</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Chronicles 21:27. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3419739442591293588">notes</a></p>

<p>Ornan and his four sons also saw the angel</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Chronicles 21:20. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3419738113533796485">notes</a></p>

<p>This verse mentions that David purchased the site for 600 shekels of silver whereas 2 Samuel 24:24 mentions that David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen For 50 shekels of silver.</p>
<p>It may be that the threshing floor was a small portion of the whole site and that can account for the difference in price.</p>
<p>It was at this site (on Mount Moriah) that Solomon built the temple. It may be this site that Abraham was told to sacrifice his son Isaac. (Although the bible only said Isaac was to be sacrificed on one of the mountains of Moriah).</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 CHRONICLES 21:18, 1 CHRONICLES 21:25, 2 CHRONICLES 3:1. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2795131597493100779">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1ch-2126">1CH 21:26</h2>
<p>The only other people I know God answered their offerings by fire apart from David (1 Chronicles 21:26) was Aaron (Leviticus 9:24), Elijah and Solomon (2 Chronicles 7:1). I was led to believe as a young boy that Abel?s offering was accepted by fire. Although I haven?t seen anything like that in the bible.</p>
