## 1CH 7:24

Even though Beriah?s name means (on misfortune), he bore a daughter who made a good name. We?ve always read about men building cities but this lady whose name was Sheerah made a name for herself.

The fact that you had a past shouldn?t determine your future. She could have decided that since my father?s name means misfortune, then I would continue to live unfortunate by doing nothing. But no, that didn?t determine her fate.

She was the first woman builder mentioned in the bible. She wasn?t just a builder, she built up three different places (Lower and upper Beth-Horon and Uzzen-Sheerah [after her name])
