## JOB 3:25

Job always sacrificed animals for his children because he thought they might have cursed God in their heart but unfortunately, they died anyway.

One thing to notice is that Satan is trying to break the link between righteousness and blessings, so that he would expose the righteous man for the sinner he is (by cursing God) - NASB study Bible


It is also great to know that God himself didn't kill any of Job's children nor did he inflict him with sores or ruin his business. It was Satan who did everything but God gave him permission to do it.
