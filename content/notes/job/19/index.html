<p>Many people deserted Job in his affliction. It is easy to say you suffered this because you have sinned but that&rsquo;s not always true. Job is so confident that he hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong that he is willing to go to court with God but needs a lawyer. But what lawyer can even stand before the almighty God.</p>
<p>Job accused God of doing evil to him. Although God didn&rsquo;t do any of these. It was the devil&rsquo;s hands at work. Only that God permitted the devil to kill his family and possession, steal his health and joy and destroy his relationship with People.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s family even desert him. Even his servants refused to answer him and he the master has to beg the servant to do things for him. It is in times of adversity that you know the true ones.</p>
<p>It is when the fire is kindled that the snake comes out into the open</p>
