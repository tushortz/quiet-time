## JOB 1:21

What a man. A financial tycoon. A spiritual giant, a great man lost everything overnight and yet he did not curse God.

What a man. Imagine waking up one day and offering burnt offerings to God for 10 children and hear that 7000 sheeps (goods) are dead, 3000 camels (cars) have been stolen, more than 99.9% of your servants (employees) are dead and your 10 children who are meant to inherit and keep you company are also dead all in a day.


How could Job have borne so many bad news in a single day. The Bible says that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tested beyond our capacity to bear it but he will provide a way out - 1 Corinthians 10:13.

For Job to have been heavily tested that way reveals Job's level of spirituality and yet he didn't sin not curse God.

What are you going through. Is it because you didn't eat at night because there was no money or you lost a loved one and then you say "There is no God".

Don't make a mistake and forfeit your destiny. This is the time to be faithful and realise you are being tested. Be faithful through your temptations and trials and when you come out of it, God will bless you more.

## JOB 1:8

God's testimony of a man named Job. What a man. He was rich but didn't say he doesn't need God anymore and that there is no God.


Wealthy and the greatest of all the men in the east. None was like him in all the earth yet he was blameless and upright.

What is your excuse for not serving God?
