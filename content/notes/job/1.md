## JOB 1:3

the reason is because Solomon's wisdom was not of this world. it was God's wisdom. the wisdom of God although foolishness to men elevated Solomon to the highest position of honour just like it did for Job who was the greatest of the men of the east because he feared God and shunned evil.

Solomon's God-given wisdom was tested when he was confronted with two harlots thing over whose child was the dead one and which was the living one.

when he requested for the sword,his subjects would have thought he was out of his mind but the sword was to know the thoughts and intentions of the heart of the two harlots.
