## JOB 23:10

Job is confident he hadn't done anything to deserve anything he was facing due to the understanding of his time that blessings is directly proportional to godliness (which is actually true in the long run).

Job is now experienced to know that in the short run that isn't necessarily always true yet his friends accuse him of wickedness.

Job thinks when God has tried him, he will be found innocent of the punishment he's facing due to his sin.

this is what also makes God an enigma
