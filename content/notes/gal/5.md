## GAL 5:11

The preaching of salvation THROUGH Jesus Christ is the stumbling block of the jews because they chose to attain salvation through works of the law and especially with circumcision rather than by faith but the problem here is that you can't pick and choose which you want to obey.

As the scripture says in James 2:10
"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it."
