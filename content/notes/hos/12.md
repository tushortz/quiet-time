## HOS 12:4

Jacob was a man that valued blessings. He override the curses of Adam and thieves by stealing blessings from Esau. He also made a covenant with God that provoked blessings in the form of tithing.

It didn?t stop there, he also pleaded with the Angel of the Lord and would not let him go (with tears) until the Angel (God) blessed him and changed his name.
