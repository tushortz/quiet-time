## DAN 3:18

In the case of the three Hebrew men who refused to bow down to the idol. They were convicted and would rather lose their life than worship an idol.

They boldly went against the order of the king even though the penalty was being roasted to ashes. Thank God God delivered them. It was through their obedience that Nebuchadnezzar saw the pre-incarnate Christ and made a proclamation that no other God could save from the fire but God alone who even saved us from hell when Jesus died on the cross for our sins.
