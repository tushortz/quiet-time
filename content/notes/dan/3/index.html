		<h2 id="dan-315">DAN 3:15</h2>
<p>This has been the statement of mighty rulers before their downfall. Senacherrib taunted the God of Israel as well as Nebuchadnezzar before their downfall</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Chronicles 32:13-17, Daniel 3:15. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3474887589155823939">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="dan-318">DAN 3:18</h2>
<p>In the case of the three Hebrew men who refused to bow down to the idol. They were convicted and would rather lose their life than worship an idol.</p>
<p>They boldly went against the order of the king even though the penalty was being roasted to ashes. Thank God God delivered them. It was through their obedience that Nebuchadnezzar saw the pre-incarnate Christ and made a proclamation that no other God could save from the fire but God alone who even saved us from hell when Jesus died on the cross for our sins.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: DANIEL 3:16-18, DANIEL 3:29. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2794772332664315998">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="dan-328">DAN 3:28</h2>
<p>Faithfulness in time of trouble was rewarded. Violating earthly authority that goes against heavenly decrees</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Daniel 3:28. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3617613995588706754">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="dan-325">DAN 3:25</h2>
<p>The pre-incarnate Christ came to the rescue of his faithful people. They must have really had relationship with Jesus</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Daniel 3:25. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3617613578481951168">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="dan-330">DAN 3:30</h2>
<p>The end result of those who stick with God through thick and thin. The end of the faithful e.g. Esther, Joseph, Daniel etc.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Daniel 3:30. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3617613006345331132">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="dan-36">DAN 3:6</h2>
<p>Just like in the time of Daniel when the three Hebrew men. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were told to pledge allegiance to the idol of Nebuchadnezzar or be thrown in the lake of fire.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Daniel 3:6, Revelation 13:8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3651676890630710193">notes</a></p>
