## EST 10:3

Just like Joseph was, Mordecai was also second in command to the king of a heathen nation. He was also great and the reason for his greatest us described. 

Because he worked for the good of his people and spoke for the welfare and peace of his nation.

There is no need to be jealous or angry. When you are in power, you can't use it for evil or you will be destroyed. Haman had his chance, Jezebel has her chance. Many people had their chances but others like Joseph, Mordecai, Nehemiah also had their chances but they used it for the good of their people and not for selfish gains
