## EST 8:17

God can make a bad thing good and he did. God never forsook his people even in the land of captivity. It is amazing how not once was God mentioned in the whole of this book but the Jews had to fast and pray until their captivity was turned.

God had used Mordecai and Esther to bring relief to the Jews and salvation to the gentiles. This story of Esther and Mordecai is quite similar to the story of Joseph.

God used both to accomplish his mission and bring salvation to the gentiles
