<h2 id="deu-111">DEU 1:11</h2>
<p>Amen. God multiplied them inspite of their unfaithfulness because of the oath he made with Abraham.</p>
<p>God is not unreasonable, he had to let Moses learn a lot of things so that he would be fit for the task at hand, Moses was humble and very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>Aaron and Moses were needed for 40 years work and they died as soon as their service was not needed anymore.</p>
<p>There were people who would replace them that had been well trained</p>
