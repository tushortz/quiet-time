## DEU 24:19

What is common between the foreigner, the orphan and the widow.

The foreigner - Not in his own country, 
The orphan - Has lost his/her parents
The widow - Her husband is dead

All three of them are lacking vital things in life that makes them incomplete but thank God he is a husband to the widow, a parent to the orphan and a safe refuge to the foreigner

## DEU 24:13

Clothing and warmth is very important for survival as much as food and shelter but from the other end, mercy is also required. God is also showing a way to show love and get a blessing from the poor borrower.

Actually in the end, showing an act of kindness results in blessings and accredited righteousness
