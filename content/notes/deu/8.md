## DEU 8:3

The manna ceased but the law lasted forever. Man cannot live forever by eating bread or manna but man will have everlasting life if he abides by the word of God.

both manna and the commandments were given by God yet one was more important than the other.

The commandments lasted generations but the manna didn't even though both were provided by God. it goes to show that the spiritual is greater than the natural. this was what made the difference between Moses and Joshua vs the Israelites.
