## EXO 32:11

Moses understood the heart of God. I don't think God really wanted to destroy them. that would have been the last resort because my God is full of mercy and compassion.

Moses reversed the word. Whereas God had initially said to Moses, YOUR PEOPLE, Moses now interceded telling God that this is YOUR PEOPLE whom you brought out of Egypt
