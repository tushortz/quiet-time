## EXO 13:17

God would not take the Israelites through shortcuts because they were not able to prove their preparation for warfare otherwise they would return back to Egypt, the land of son and bondage. Instead he take them through roundabouts, even though it was long, it was to prepare them carefully for the future and the promises ahead.

They had to be trained and tested so that they can be purified and fit for the promise land

**Related verses**: Sh'mot (Exo) 13:17. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2436385517828039279)
