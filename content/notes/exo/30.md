## EXO 30:33

The Holy anointing oil is sacred and must neither be poured on a layman nor made in the same composition because the anointing oil is sacred and represents the Holy spirit. there is nothing else in comparison with the Holy Spirit.

It must only be poured in those chosen to be anointed by God
