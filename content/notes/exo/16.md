## EXO 16:33

The manna ceased but the law lasted forever. Man cannot live forever by eating bread or manna but man will have everlasting life if he abides by the word of God.

both manna and the commandments were given by God yet one was more important than the other.

The commandments lasted generations but the manna didn't even though both were provided by God. it goes to show that the spiritual is greater than the natural. this was what made the difference between Moses and Joshua vs the Israelites.

## EXO 16:24

Normally the manna would become wormy if left till the next day but on the instructions of God given by Moses when the leaders of the congregation went to him. it didn't rot. It pays to listen to instructions form the leader God has put in charge of you.

I must be a doer and obey instructions

## EXO 16:3

doubt + fear = anger

## EXO 16:12

I used to feel pity on the Israelites but then I realised I could easily have done the same. Imagine being in slavery but have food to eat but then bring rescued and realising you're subjected to the harsh weather that the wilderness provides, heat, thirst, long journey, tiredness and little or no food.

What I learn is to trust God and not murmur. Instead think about what God has done for me in the past and trust in his wisdom
