## EXO 4:4

God was sending Moses to the Israelites but not without signs and wonders. He empowered Moses to do the undoable.

Moses ran away from the staff turned snake but God told him to take the snake by the tail. 'Who does that'. God was directly telling him to confront his fears. God was saying 'i make the harmless deadly and the deadly harmless.

Second empowerment was turning a healthy hand to a diseased one and a diseased one to a healthy flesh. I am the Lord that heals you


Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. Cast out demons, heal the sick, raise the dead. - Matthew 10:7-8.

God will not send you on a mission without empowering you with the necessary artillery.
