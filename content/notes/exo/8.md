Omnipresent God

## EXO 8:18

This book shows that the occult, magic arts and witchcraft is real. The devil can mimic God?s power but no one has the ability to create life except Yahweh. 

The sorcerers were able to turn a staff to a snake, water into blood and bring out frogs from the river Nile but were unable to create gnats from the dust. 

God showed that he alone was the creator

**Related verses**: Exodus 8:18. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3258817123850118136)
