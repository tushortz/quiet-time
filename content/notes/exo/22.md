## EXO 22:28

He cursed the king and the punishment that David saw fit was death. I must be careful not to curse God or even the leader he has placed above me even in my thoughts because nothing is secret in this world. it's only a matter of time

## EXO 22:2

It then is better not to be a thief at all because what's the point of stealing and being killed at night. Or stealing in the morning and bringing disgrace to yourself. Apart from the disgrace, you have to pay double more of what you stole if it's alive or even more if it's been killed or sold. 

Or still worse, if the thief is caught in daylight and can't afford to pay back, he will be sold as a slave where he has to work hard for six years before being released all just because of one thing he stole.

Seems like all these judgement has more to do with encouraging hardworking and not laziness. Perhaps being idle will make you think of taking the short route to achieving something.

As an adage says: An Idle mind is the devil's workshop
