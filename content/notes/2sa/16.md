## 2SA 16:12

David is still hopeful in God and doesn't mind being wronged. It would pain David very well because everything was s result of his actions and he would feel the guilt each time.

He learnt obedience by the things he suffered. I don't have to suffer the same fate to learn obedience. I can learn from his life and pattern myself quickly

## 2SA 16:23

Ahithophel had a gift of wise and divine counsel but because of offence, he used it the wrong way as an instrument of destruction of the Lord's anointed. Although that didn't work, he ended up hanging himself.

As long as God's gift is channelled the right way, it will be used to bless people but it becomes an instrument of destruction if used negatively. Be careful not to misuse God's gift because of temporary situations in life.
