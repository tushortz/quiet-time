<p>He cursed the king and the punishment that David saw fit was death. I must be careful not to curse God or even the leader he has placed above me even in my thoughts because nothing is secret in this world. it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Exodus 22:28, 2 Samuel 16:5, 1 Kings 2:9, Ecclesiastes 10:20. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3424339591917461859">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1612">2SA 16:12</h2>
<p>David is still hopeful in God and doesn&rsquo;t mind being wronged. It would pain David very well because everything was s result of his actions and he would feel the guilt each time.</p>
<p>He learnt obedience by the things he suffered. I don&rsquo;t have to suffer the same fate to learn obedience. I can learn from his life and pattern myself quickly</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 16:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3415424139858272466">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-166">2SA 16:6</h2>
<p>The characters of everyone was not seen during this trouble. It is true that the serpent would come out of its hiding when there is heat</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 16:6-8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3415422772322230471">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-164">2SA 16:4</h2>
<p>Siva the servant took all of Mephiboseth&rsquo;s inheritance through lies. Mercy what a bad servant</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 16:4. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3415421255125033142">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1623">2SA 16:23</h2>
<p>Ahithophel had a gift of wise and divine counsel but because of offence, he used it the wrong way as an instrument of destruction of the Lord&rsquo;s anointed. Although that didn&rsquo;t work, he ended up hanging himself.</p>
<p>As long as God&rsquo;s gift is channelled the right way, it will be used to bless people but it becomes an instrument of destruction if used negatively. Be careful not to misuse God&rsquo;s gift because of temporary situations in life.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 16:23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2645708844600910713">notes</a></p>
