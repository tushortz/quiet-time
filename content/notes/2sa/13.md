## 2SA 13:13

By raping Tamar, Amnon forfeited his chance to become the next King in Israel. He also forfeited his life and caused Tamar to be disgraced because she would no longer be given in marriage since she had lost her virginity, the sign of her pride as a woman.

Normally Amnon should be executed according to the law but because David did not take any action, Absalom took the law in his hands. Things never remained the same for David after his adultery with BathSheba and the killing of Uriah. basically the same thing that David did happened to David's son
