<p>By raping Tamar, Amnon forfeited his chance to become the next King in Israel. He also forfeited his life and caused Tamar to be disgraced because she would no longer be given in marriage since she had lost her virginity, the sign of her pride as a woman.</p>
<p>Normally Amnon should be executed according to the law but because David did not take any action, Absalom took the law in his hands. Things never remained the same for David after his adultery with BathSheba and the killing of Uriah. basically the same thing that David did happened to David&rsquo;s son</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:13-14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414670940109005526">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1332">2SA 13:32</h2>
<p>I need to be careful when invited to an event especially one that is with someone that isn&rsquo;t really happy or friendly towards me.</p>
<p>Absalom&rsquo;s deep-seated anger led to him revenging by killing Amnon the oldest son and successor to the throne</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:32. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414663917476766280">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1322">2SA 13:22</h2>
<p>Neutrality is dangerous and can be a sign of deep-seated resentment or anger.</p>
<p>Absalom didn&rsquo;t say with good or bad. Even God said I wish you were hot or cold</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:22. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414661210456187458">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1321">2SA 13:21</h2>
<p>Failure to take action especially as a king ruling as God&rsquo;s representative have grave consequences but it was difficult for David to execute his own son</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:21. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414657474522505769">notes</a></p>

<p>Similar to the coat of many colours that was given to Joseph. the coat represents the father&rsquo;s love and purity (as of virginity). It also represents the anointing</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:18. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414656496998015511">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-133">2SA 13:3</h2>
<p>I must beware of the company of friends I keep because they can cause my death through wicked advice.</p>
<p>Jonadab gave Amnon a very bad advise and he obeyed and that was the beginning of the deaths of 3 of David&rsquo;s sons as well as war in his household</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 13:3. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3414652782371398130">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1337">2SA 13:37</h2>
<p>We need to take actions when things go wrong otherwise it would go worse. If David had taken action against Tamar&rsquo;s rape, his two sons Amon and Absalom would not have died.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 13:37. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2644949022439891763">notes</a></p>
