## 2SA 12:10

David had uttered curses and it came to pass as the Lord's anointed and now God himself was pronouncing judgement on David because he despised God's word and married another man's wife.


What brought about the curse was despising the word of God as we have seen and will continue to see over and over again

## 2SA 12:6

David did not understand that the proverb was directly meant for him and pronounced judgement immediately not knowing he was pronouncing judgement on himself.

Here David sinned by allowing sexual desire to overwhelm his compassion
