<p>Abundance of sons was a sign of God&rsquo;s blessings. the Bible said God blessed the house of Obed-edom on account of the ark that was kept in his place. He took care of God&rsquo;s ark and received a blessing.</p>
<p>He also had the privilege to be a gatekeeper on the side where the King was to pass so he got to see the King everytime</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 6:11, 1 Chronicles 26:4-5. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3421820525197648595">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-623">2SA 6:23</h2>
<p>David had intention to bless his house but Michal had intention to insult the king. David wasn&rsquo;t naked by the way. he was wearing the short priestly linen ephod (a close-fitting, sleeveless pullover usually of hip length) rather than his kingly robe.</p>
<p>I think it was jealousy and pride that made Michal speak out especially because David was dancing in front of his maid servants while Michal was watching from the window.</p>
<p>unfortunately David wanted to bless his household but Michal received a curse instead.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 6:20-23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3410332052771037463">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-616">2SA 6:16</h2>
<p>i must not see myself as too dignified regarding any position I occupy. I must be careful not to let pride overtake me. Michal viewed David with contempt and became barren.</p>
<p>It is true I need to keep my heart with all diligence otherwise it will affect the course of my whole life</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 6:16. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3409550676501192715">notes</a></p>

<p>After the mistake of transporting the ark like the Philistines, the ark was placed in the house of Obed-Edom and God blessed him</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 6:11. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3409420574140391740">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-67">2SA 6:7</h2>
<p>God saw the touching of the ark as irreverence. God didn&rsquo;t kill the Philistines when they&rsquo;ve sent the ark to Israel.</p>
<p>God had shown Israel how to move the ark. it was to be through priests carrying it by the poles but Israel moved the ark on a cart moved by a cow and God killed Uzzah for his error.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not enough to do good. in fact doing good can be deadly if it&rsquo;s not inline with God&rsquo;s instructions</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 6:7. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3408858399697002787">notes</a></p>
