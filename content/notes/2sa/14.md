## 2SA 14:30

This just explains the character of Absalom. Joan was trying to help him by bringing him back from exile. He was meant to be the next King as the oldest son alive. Because Joab would not come to him, he went and set his field on fire.

I believe it was one of the reason Joab killed him during the war to also revenge his field being set on fire.

Absalom and Joab has similar characteristics
