## 2SA 8:16

This Jehoshaphat is not to be confused with the other King in later times after David.

Josh attained his position as the commander over the army because he attacked the Jebusites first when David wanted to war with Jebus and they were preventing and taunting him.

see 1 Chronicles 11:6
