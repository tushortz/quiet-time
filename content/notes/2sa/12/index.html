<p>God loved the child. wow. Loved from a baby</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 12:24. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3413904941801792015">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1213">2SA 12:13</h2>
<p>David instant repentance led to forgiveness. It looks like God always give one chance before judgement as in the case of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam but he blamed his wife</li>
<li>Eve but she blamed the serpent</li>
<li>Cain but he lied</li>
<li>Saul but he blamed the people</li>
<li>David but he instantly repented</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 12:13. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3413172108393177955">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-129">2SA 12:9</h2>
<p>Disobeying God and doing evil is to despise God. Even though Uriah died in war, God views his death as David directly killing him because he was the mastermind behind Uriah&rsquo;s death</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 12:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3413169725147702096">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-128">2SA 12:8</h2>
<ul>
<li>God anointed David</li>
<li>spared him from Saul.</li>
<li>gave him the Kingdom</li>
<li>God said he would have given more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 12:7-9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3413166050803180334">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1223">2SA 12:23</h2>
<p>Sign of a belief in an afterlife. There was not yet an anointing to raise the dead. The anointing to lead, perform miracles and fight wars was already present</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 12:23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2644307335677993099">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1220">2SA 12:20</h2>
<ul>
<li>Washed - Read the word of God</li>
<li>Anointed himself - Ask for the help of the Holy Spirit</li>
<li>Changed his clothes - Ask for forgiveness</li>
<li>Worship - Worship</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 12:20. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2644306152741658749">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1210">2SA 12:10</h2>
<p>David had uttered curses and it came to pass as the Lord&rsquo;s anointed and now God himself was pronouncing judgement on David because he despised God&rsquo;s word and married another man&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>What brought about the curse was despising the word of God as we have seen and will continue to see over and over again</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 12:10. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2644301958806757479">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-126">2SA 12:6</h2>
<p>David did not understand that the proverb was directly meant for him and pronounced judgement immediately not knowing he was pronouncing judgement on himself.</p>
<p>When David said, the man must make restitution 4 times, Bathsheba&rsquo;s first son to David died, Amnon, Absalom and Adonijah also died</p>
<p>Here David sinned by allowing sexual desire to overwhelm his compassion</p>
