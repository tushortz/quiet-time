## 2SA 17:25

The key to understanding the family relationship here is that Amasa was the son of Ithra and Abigail (David's sister and daughter of Nahash (Ithra). it is likely Jesse married her mother after the death of her father)

Abigail was the half-sister of David and also a sister to Zeruiah (the mother of Joab, Asahel and Abishai)
