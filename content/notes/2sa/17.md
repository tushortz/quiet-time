## 2SA 17:25

The key to understanding the family relationship here is that Amasa was the son of Ithra and Abigail (David's sister and daughter of Nahash (Ithra). it is likely Jesse married her mother after the death of her father)

Abigail was the half-sister of David and also a sister to Zeruiah (the mother of Joab, Asahel and Abishai)

## 2SA 17:23

His led started because of Unforgiveness. he wanted a revenge for what David had done so he joined with Absalom.

Unfortunately he hanged himself because he himself knew that if his advice wasn't followed, they would be defeated and David will regain position as king and in this case he would be found to be a traitor and be subjected to open shame.

## 2SA 17:14

The advice of Ahithophel was perfectly sound. It would take 12,000 men to exterminate David alone using the counsel of a man whose counsel was like the Lord's but God thwarted that advice through Hushai so that destruction would come on Absalom because of his rebellion against his father. This was a response to David's prayer

Men give ideas and make plans but in the end, the counsel of God comes to pass
