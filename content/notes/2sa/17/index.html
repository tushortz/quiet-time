<p>The key to understanding the family relationship here is that Amasa was the son of Ithra and Abigail (David&rsquo;s sister and daughter of Nahash (Ithra). it is likely Jesse married her mother after the death of her father)</p>
<p>Abigail was the half-sister of David and also a sister to Zeruiah (the mother of Joab, Asahel and Abishai)</p>

<p>His led started because of Unforgiveness. he wanted a revenge for what David had done so he joined with Absalom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he hanged himself because he himself knew that if his advice wasn&rsquo;t followed, they would be defeated and David will regain position as king and in this case he would be found to be a traitor and be subjected to open shame.</p>

<p>Wise man, friend and counsellor. He quickly overturned the advise of Ahithophel even though it was the best course of action to take</p>

<p>Ahithophel was wise but let revenge get the best of him and was destroyed</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 17:2. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3415427654282371306">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1729">2SA 17:29</h2>
<p>God is always with his favoured servant even when it doesn&rsquo;t seem so. God provides David&rsquo;s necessities and defended him against evil plots.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 17:29. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2645720014871323551">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-1714">2SA 17:14</h2>
<p>The advice of Ahithophel was perfectly sound. It would take 12,000 men to exterminate David alone using the counsel of a man whose counsel was like the Lord&rsquo;s but God thwarted that advice through Hushai so that destruction would come on Absalom because of his rebellion against his father. This was a response to David&rsquo;s prayer</p>
<p>Men give ideas and make plans but in the end, the counsel of God comes to pass</p>

<h2 id="2sa-174">2SA 17:4</h2>
<p>Was it not the elders of Israel that anointed David king? How come they were soon to turn against him.</p>
