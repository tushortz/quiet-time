<p>David actions affirmed that he was not involved in the death of Abner through fasting and refusing to eat even when urged</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 3:37. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3406900664776516476">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-335">2SA 3:35</h2>
<p>In Jewish counting of days and night. A day starts at evening of this day and ends at the evening of the next day. David fasted for the death of Abner by not eating while it was day</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 3:35. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3406900090156868465">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-329">2SA 3:29</h2>
<p>David placed on Joab and his generations a curse to this effect.</p>
<p>there will always be someone affected by disease, war or famine (these are the curses of revelation relating to the three horse men).</p>
<p>these three curses has always been the main thing that ravages the earth today and seems like it&rsquo;s a form of divine sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 3:29. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3406898780317672286">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-327">2SA 3:27</h2>
<p>This was murder and revenge in wickedness. Abner killed Joab&rsquo;s brother Asahel in self-defence after he had warned him several times to stop chasing him. now Joab lied by calling back Abner as if it was the king who sent for him and murdered him</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 3:27. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3406895771139433268">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-39">2SA 3:9</h2>
<p>Abner knew he was practicing open rebellion to God by not letting David take over Israel but instituting Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul on the throne. He is not even a prophet to ordain anyone as king. Abner died an untimely death just as Absalom and everyone who are rebels</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 SAMUEL 3:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2640606837699502314">notes</a></p>
