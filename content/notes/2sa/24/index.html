<p>David made preparations to build the temple but the site where it was to be built was not known but through the pestilence, the site where Solomon was to build it was revealed and David bought it from the hands of a Jebusite.</p>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field - Matthew 13:44</p>

<p>Judgement from God usually come in the form of Sword, famine and disease</p>

<ul>
<li>God showed David the Angel of destruction about to attack Jerusalem</li>
<li>then he sent the prophet Gad to tell David to sacrifice</li>
<li>Once David had offered sacrifice and prayers, the plague was held back</li>

<p>David bought the threshing floor of Araunah (Ornan) the Jebusite. this was where Solomon ended up building the temple.</p>
<p>It cost David 50 shekels of silver (50 days wages. Since half a shekel was the temple tax)</p>

<h2 id="2sa-2417">2SA 24:17</h2>
<p>David saw the Angel and prayed and pleaded to God to only attack him rather than the people, God relented of the disaster.</p>
<p>It is actually not a coincidence that we are actually praying for visions to see Angels</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 24:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3419725080950464556">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-2416">2SA 24:16</h2>
<p>The Angel was about to attack Jerusalem which means Vision of peace (city of the great king and God&rsquo;s headquarters on earth) then God paused judgement.</p>
<p>it was on this threshing floor that Solomon built the temple</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 24:16. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3419724336327286820">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-2410">2SA 24:10</h2>
<p>even though he counted the people in pride (a sign that he was drifting from trusting God to trusting in the military might) and his abilities, David didn&rsquo;t ignore his conscience but asked for forgiveness from God immediately although this wasn&rsquo;t without punishment</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Samuel 24:10. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3419721658859773960">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2sa-2414">2SA 24:14</h2>
<p>In the midst of the troubles, David trusted in God&rsquo;s mercy than the mercy of men.</p>
<p>We are made to understand from the events here that</p>
<ul>
<li>God&rsquo;s mercy is greater than man&rsquo;s</li>
<li>the site where the plague stopped and sacrifice was made was the place where Solomon built the temple of God</li>
<li>God is a compassionate God</li>
<li>Prayer can withhold God&rsquo;s judgement</li>
</ul>
