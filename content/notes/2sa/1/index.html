<p>Jonathan was a great man, a great friend. He was going to be the King after Saul but trusted in God and because he knew David was to replace him because of his father&rsquo;s disobedience, he still supported David, helped him, provided for him and loved him.</p>
<p>What a great friend</p>

<p>The Amalekite hoping he would get some form of reward and honour took Saul&rsquo;s crown and arm band to David and lied that he killed Saul. unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t go well with him because David was had the principle of not touching the Lord&rsquo;s anonited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arm band has been used since long ago as seen here probably to dictate the leader.</p>
<p>in football nowadays the arm band is still won to depict the captain (leader)</p>
