## 2CH 6:35

The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.

Jews should face 
* the temple when in Jerusalem
* Jerusalem when outside Canaan

Gentiles
* need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple

Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :). The revelation that gentiles could also worship God outside the Holy land can be seen when Namaan asked Elisha if it was possible and Elisha gave a yes to the question
