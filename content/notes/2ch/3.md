## 2CH 3:1

God also told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on the mountain of Moriah. I wouldn?t be surprised if it was exactly this location that God sent Abraham to perform the sacrifcie.

I checked the NASB Study Bible and it says it was the same spot

## 2CH 3:1

This verse mentions that David purchased the site for 600 shekels of silver whereas 2 Samuel 24:24 mentions that David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen For 50 shekels of silver.

It may be that the threshing floor was a small portion of the whole site and that can account for the difference in price. 

It was at this site (on Mount Moriah) that Solomon built the temple. It may be this site that Abraham was told to sacrifice his son Isaac. (Although the bible only said Isaac was to be sacrificed on one of the mountains of Moriah).
