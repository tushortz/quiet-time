## 2CH 3:1

God also told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on the mountain of Moriah. I wouldn?t be surprised if it was exactly this location that God sent Abraham to perform the sacrifcie.

I checked the NASB Study Bible and it says it was the same spot

**Related verses**: 2 Chronicles 3:1. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3450932933736259893)
