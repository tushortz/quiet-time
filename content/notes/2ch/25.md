## 2CH 25:16

Not taking heed of advises especially one sent by God is dangerous. Amaziah shut up the prophet of God when he was sent to warn Amaziah.

Other examples of bad experience after rejecting advices are:

- The prophet told not to eat in Bethel when he warned Jeroboam (1 Kings 13)
- Rehoboam when advised by Elders to lighten the yoke of the people (2 Chronicles 10:6-8)
- King Ahab when warned by Micaiah not to go to battle (2 Chronicles 18:14-22)
- David when advices by Joab not to take a census of the people (1 Chronicles 21:2-7)
