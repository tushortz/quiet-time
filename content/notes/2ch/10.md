## 2CH 10:8

There is something about kindness that makes people gladly obey you. Unfortunately Rehoboam the son of Solomon was begged to be kind to them and they will serve him forever but he rejected the counsel of the elders who had been with Solomon and took advice from the young men who had grown up with him.

Unfortunately, that was a disastrous decision and he lost control of 10 of the kingdoms because the people rebelled against him.
