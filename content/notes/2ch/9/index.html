<p>Another thing to note in Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom is not just in building but in transportation. he controlled nations through control of the trade routes. that way riches reached Israel</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Chronicles 9:27. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3457305062459301948">notes</a></p>

<p>he was in a way king of kings because of his wisdom</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Chronicles 9:26. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3457304248890155063">notes</a></p>

<p>the great wisdom of Solomon compelled kings to seek him and to hear his words. his mindset was so influenced by the Holy spirit that even though he didn&rsquo;t speak in tongues or perform miracles, he did mighty works of construction.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Chronicles 9:23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3457303319549829163">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ch-922">2CH 9:22</h2>
<p>the reason is because Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was not of this world. it was God&rsquo;s wisdom. the wisdom of God although foolishness to men elevated Solomon to the highest position of honour just like it did for Job who was the greatest of the men of the east because he feared God and shunned evil.</p>
<p>Solomon&rsquo;s God-given wisdom was tested when he was confronted with two harlots thing over whose child was the dead one and which was the living one.</p>
<p>when he requested for the sword,his subjects would have thought he was out of his mind but the sword was to know the thoughts and intentions of the heart of the two harlots.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 2 Chronicles 9:22, Job 1:1, Job 1:3. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3457301328102678541">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="2ch-920">2CH 9:20</h2>
<p>Silver was not valuable in the days of Solomon. there was abundant wealth in his kingdom and divine wisdom was the initiator of these blessings.</p>
