## 2CH 11:16

In the face of adversity is the true content of a person revealed. It was during the division of these two kingdoms that the people who really wanted to seek God left their inheritance in Israel to live in Judah while others could not leave everything they own and would rather worship goat demons that Jeroboam the son of Nebat made.

Israel never remained the same again and this was just a beginning till they finally ended up in Babylon
