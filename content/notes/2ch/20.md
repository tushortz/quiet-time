## 2CH 20:23

It is very possible that what happened was along these lines:

Moab and Ammon are descended from lot whereas Edom and Israel are descended from Isaac. It could be that Moab and Ammon conspired to destroy Edom thinking that Edom could end up turning against them since Edom and Israel were of the same parents. So after Moab and Ammon had annihilated Edom, they probably realised that one had destroyed Edom since one had a strong alliance with Edom so one decided a revenge and they started fighting against each other.
