## 2CH 5:10

The jar of manna and Aaron's budded rod had probably been lost because they were both kept in the ark of the covenant along with the two stone tablets that had the 10 commandments written on it.

It shows that Aaron's rod was not meant to last forever neither was the manna but the commandments of God was to last for eternity.

Aaron's budding rod was for a sign, the manna was for a sign and also for temporary sustenance but the law was everlasting.

we don't have the stone tablets now but they have been written in our hearts for eternity
