## 2CH 33:13

God is ever gracious. Even when his temple had been profaned with idols and Manasseh had practiced all manner of abominations, God still heard his prayer.

Many times, it takes a very bad situation before we can humble ourselves and come to God. May God help us all but the good thing is God?s arm is always opened wide to receive us.
