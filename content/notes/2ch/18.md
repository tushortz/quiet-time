## 2CH 18:1

That was a terrible mistake. After this Judah could not remain the same again. Intermarrying with the daughter of an idolater, prostitute and witch.

Athaliah, the wife of Jehoshaphat almost destroyed the seed of kingship through Judah and through which the Lord Jesus Christ would come. That would have been a fatal disaster for all of us and we would be damned but thank God he is always in control of things
