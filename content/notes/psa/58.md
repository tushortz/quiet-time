## PSA 58:10

After treading on my enemies like serpents and scorpions are stepped on, I will crush them with my foot as the Lord Jesus has given me power to tread on serpents (demons) and scorpions (witches and wizards).

He has given me authority so I can crush them and wash my feet in their blood

## PSA 58:6

So that it will take time for them to recover. they will be in pain and helpless and useless to attack. render them defenseless and offenceless. Make them vulnerable since they sought to destroy my life
