## PSA 41:3

The helpless consists of the widow, orphans, strangers (aliens) in a country, the poor and those that look up to God for support and help. God has personally taken it upon himself to help them and I would do good to also help them (undertaking the work of God) and God will in return continue to bless me as I pour out the blessing to others.

God will save from trouble, protect from the enemies and restore to health
