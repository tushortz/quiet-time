## PSA 75:1

Wondrous work is a sign of God's presence. We give thanks to God for what he has done in our life.

We need to be patient and make decisions at the right time to judge uprightly. 

God speaks even to boastful and wicked people not to the arrogant since only God promotes and demotes.

The wicked will drink of God's wrath. The strength of the wicked will be cut short but Gold exalts the righteous
