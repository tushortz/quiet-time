## PSA 121:2

The hills of Jerusalem (City of peace) is where the high places of worship was located before Solomon built the temple on mount Moriah. Looking up to the hills is looking up to God and trusting him for provision. I cannot rely on man to provide for me but only God is the source and provider of my needs and is very happy to do so.

God will be there to keep the path I walk when I live righteously. God does not sleep soundly not slumber briefly. He ever lives and is ever awake watching over me. He even has angels that minister to me.

Thank you Lord for keeping me. for bring my shepherd. keeping me from harm and the negative effects of the physical world. He will keep me from all evil and save me from harm
