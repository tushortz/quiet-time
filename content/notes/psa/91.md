## PSA 91:1

The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me. 

I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that's another level.

Jesus already promised he's with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.

Obeying Jesus words confers upon me divine wisdom because of his saying in Matthew 7:24 of the two house builders and their foundation.
