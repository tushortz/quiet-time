<p>Stubborness stems from the heart. it is deep rooted and very difficult to remove</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Psalms 81:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3446595416509637429">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="psa-8114">PSA 81:14</h2>
<p>God yearns and longs to help us if only we walk in his ways. He has no obligation to help us if we don&rsquo;t because we have free will. Taking away that free will and controlling us is witchcraft.</p>
<p>He is not a witch. He wants to do the job himself. He is tired of the devil messing around with us.
He wants us to LISTEN to him and WALK IN HIS WAYS then he will QUICKLY SUBDUE and HUMBLE our enemies.</p>
<p>Death, the devil, demons, sin, disease etc. are enemies that needs to be subdued</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: PSALM 81:13-14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2615899297833279641">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="psa-8112-1">PSA 81:12</h2>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t force. He tries to warn us but if we don&rsquo;t listen, he leaves us to do our things and face the consequences. Unfortunately we blame God for our wrongs we committed.</p>
<p>He is such a loving father he will take us back after our mistakes just like the prodigal son was taken back by the father.</p>
<p>God wants the best for us but because we don&rsquo;t see the full picture, we want to go with the world. We were not born again to fit into the world, we were born to stand out and have dominion.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: PSALM 81:11-12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2615889879573979253">notes</a></p>
