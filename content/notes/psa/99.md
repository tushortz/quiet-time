## PSA 99:1

The scroll was addressed and given by the almighty father to the person who had authority to open it but no one in all creation had the authority to open the sealed scroll but once was found which was Jesus proving his divinity.

The four living creatures are the four cherubims of God's glory who carries his throne. God sits on his throne and the ark being his footstool and represents his presence.

The earth also represents God's footstool
