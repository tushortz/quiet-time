## PSA 69:10

Fasting helps to humble my soul so that it's not very responsive to the impulse of the flesh. it keeps the flesh under subjection and in a weak state so that the Holy Spirit can gain control and the spirit can gain ascendency.

**Related verses**: Psalms 69:10. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3434442233234580164)
