## PSA 115:16

The earth God has given to man to have dominion over. God rules in the heavens.

Man in his fallen state had corrupted the earth and it takes a relationship with God through prayer and his word to invite God here. Thank God we have the Holy Spirit but many people also needs to be saved so God can have a glorious welcome.
