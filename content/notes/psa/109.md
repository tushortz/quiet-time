## PSA 109:10

This scripture was quoted by Apostle Peter as a reference to Judas. If this is fully in reference to Judas, then Judas had a wife and children. He also had creditors probably why he also sold Jesus to pay for the money he was owing.

The Bible said Judas was a thief and always helped himself with the money in the offering. He was a man of cursing

the suffering part is a reference to Jesus. He was broken, crushed, oppressed and abused.

Whatever I love comes to me and whatever i do not delight in stays far from me
