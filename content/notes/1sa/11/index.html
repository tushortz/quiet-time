<p>Nahash meaning Serpent, an ammonite king of the descendants of lot went and besieged Jabesh in Israel, until Saul acted like kings do and brought the people together in unity, nothing could be done. God gave them victory over Nahash.</p>
<p>When we believers gather together in unity, the serpent goes down and his hordes are scatttered</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 11:1. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2621018854273049521">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-1113">1SA 11:13</h2>
<p>Saul here was still humble and attributing things (victory) to God. He was still young in the business</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 11:13. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2621015392411968427">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-114">1SA 11:4</h2>
<p>God was their king, he fought their battles for them when they cried out to him. Now they had asked for an earthly king and they got it.</p>
<p>Normally they would have cried to God but this time, they didn&rsquo;t. They cried to the people until Saul heard it and God moved Saul to fight their battles for him (God). Saul was God&rsquo;s representative for Israel</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 11:4. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2621014126621352873">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-115">1SA 11:5</h2>
<p>Saul had already been anointed king but was still behind the plough. Until this event happened, his kingly destiny had not been confirmed. We should never miss our timing when the spirit is leading.</p>
<p>Saul was anointed a king for warfare. We Christians are not just born again to warm the chairs but to fight in closed doors on our knees.</p>

<h2 id="1sa-112">1SA 11:2</h2>
<p>Nahash the Ammonite&rsquo;s plan was to disgrace Israel by plucking one eye out of the men of Jabesh Gilead but God turned it for good. God&rsquo;s spirit came on Saul for warfare.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 11:2. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2620815533918643052">notes</a></p>
