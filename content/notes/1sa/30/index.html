<p>David and his men were accustomed to go to visit Elders in different places in Judah even during his exile</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 30:31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3405984395990655769">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-3026">1SA 30:26</h2>
<p>David had elders as friends and sent gifts to them. He walked among old men who were elders of Judah and were responsible for making judgements in the city gates.</p>
<p>He that walks with the wise will also be wise</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 30:26. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3405983724054766357">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-3023">1SA 30:23</h2>
<p>David recognised the victory over the Amalekites as the Lord&rsquo;s even though he went to get back his possessions</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 30:23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3405982482347844369">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-3014">1SA 30:14</h2>
<p>Aside from the raid it looks like the Amalekites had retaliated because David had raided them and other countries in the past. Although the Amalekites killed none of their captives.</p>
<p>The Amalekites only attacked Ziklag the town that Achish king of Gath gave David as well as the south country of Judah and neighbouring towns</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 30:1, 1 Samuel 30:14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3405979940037583614">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-3024">1SA 30:24</h2>
<p>Equality.</p>
<p>It was God who gave the victory, the 400 men were only instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 30:24. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2639158568427446330">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-306">1SA 30:6</h2>
<p>In times of distress, the safe place of comfort is in God. Encourage yourself in God.</p>
<p>The God who did it in the past will do it again. He has not changed</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 30:6. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2638379592297734299">notes</a></p>
