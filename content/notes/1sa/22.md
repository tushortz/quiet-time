## 1SA 22:13

Now I understand why. Because of Doeg's report. But Saul is deceived and twisting the truth

Saul had 600 men in Gibeah and since David had run to the cave of Adullam where he got 400 men, a priest and a prophet and since David had now returned to Judah, it was logical to think David had gathered himself people, priest and prophet which is required for a King and had returned in order to fight Saul

## 1SA 22:2

David had gain valuable leadership experience in the house of Saul. His life was now in danger and he had been put in charge of another (approximately 400) men. At least we know that David's brothers (Eliab, Abinadab, Shammah, Nethanel, Raddai and Orem) came to meet him as well as or most likely (Joab, Abishai and Asahel) 

Now he had the support of what a King would have, a runaway priest named Abiathar/Ahimelech (escaped when Saul killed members of his household for helping David when he fled from Saul), the prophet Gad and other men who were debtors, sorrowful or in a bad situation
