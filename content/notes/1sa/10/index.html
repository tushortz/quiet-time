<p>it&rsquo;s an insult not to bring a gift before the appointed ruler. they treated Saul with contempt (God&rsquo;s choice)</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 10:27. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3395170330125001517">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-106">1SA 10:6</h2>
<p>To be changed into another man is for one&rsquo;s heart to be changed. God can change me heart.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 10:6, 1 Samuel 10:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3395167475724968727">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-106-1">1SA 10:6</h2>
<p>After the spirit comes upon me, I will prophesy, be changed into another person, my mindset will be transformed to think in God&rsquo;s line of direction.</p>
<p>it means God is with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth <em>with the Holy Spirit and with power</em>. Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, <em>for God was with him</em>&rdquo; - Acts 10:38</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 10:6-7. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3395165799790142216">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-106-2">1SA 10:6</h2>
<p>I need the Holy Spirit to prophesy and to be changed into another man</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 Samuel 10:6. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3395163177603556083">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-101">1SA 10:1</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why Saul was anointed in secret. David was first anointed in the midst of his brothers. Solomon was anointed in the chambers. Jehu was also anointed by one of the sons of the prophet after being commanded by Elijah and he was anointed in the inner room.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the significance of secret anointing? Is it that God doesn&rsquo;t want it to be in public.</p>
<p>At the mouth of two or three witnesses a word is established. God, Samuel and Saul witnessed the kingly anointing on Saul. He was 30 years old though called a young man in his days</p>
