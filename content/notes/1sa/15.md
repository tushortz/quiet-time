**Related verses**: 1 Samuel 15:12. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/3396941492974773219)


## 1SA 15:9

The sin here is that they consciously disobeyed God by destroying every bad thing but left the best. Willful selection. Saul spared Agag because he wanted it to boost his ego since Agag has become his prisoner of war.

For those who were with Saul, he wanted to be the respected king among them by giving them the best of the spoils of war but the booty was God's because everything was to be devoted to destruction.

in that way Saul Dishonored God by taking what is rightfully God's for himself
