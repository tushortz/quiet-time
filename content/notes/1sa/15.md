God gave the Victory but Saul took the glory

## 1SA 15:9

The sin here is that they consciously disobeyed God by destroying every bad thing but left the best. Willful selection. Saul spared Agag because he wanted it to boost his ego since Agag has become his prisoner of war.

For those who were with Saul, he wanted to be the respected king among them by giving them the best of the spoils of war but the booty was God's because everything was to be devoted to destruction.

in that way Saul Dishonored God by taking what is rightfully God's for himself

Rebellion, disobedience and rejection of God's word were the three-fold sin of Saul that led to his rejection as a King of Israel

## 1SA 15:21

Saul was arguing in the midst of evidence. Attempting to justify sin by sacrifice. 

For some reason, up until now, when Saul references God, he has told Samuel twice "... to the Lord YOUR God" and not ... MY God.

I don't think Saul knew God personally

## 1SA 15:19

- disobedience 
- greed

He disobeyed God because of greed and pride which is sin and caused him to be demoted.

Pride demotes you in the kingdom.

## 1SA 15:19

Now the main reason has been revealed. They swooped down on the plunder even though they were clearly instructed to destroy everything.

In the time of Esther, the descendants of Agag named Haman decided to wipeout the entire Israeli generations. If only Saul had obeyed at this time ...

If the Israelites were wiped out, where will the Messiah come from ... we would be doomed. 

In fact Saul's relatives in the newer generations were to be wiped out Modecai, Esther etc ..

## 1SA 15:15

In verse 9, we read Saul and the people spared the best animals

In verse 15, we read Saul saying the people spared. That is trying to take oneself away from the blame. Is Saul a competent leader?, Why does Saul even like sacrifice too much.

In his first disobedience, he sacrificed animals he was not lawful to do, now he's bringing cursed objects doomed for destruction to be sacrificed

Related verses: 1 SAMUEL 15:9, 1 SAMUEL 15:15. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2628264774245016131)


## 1SA 15:15

God faces the leader not the people. The leader faces the harshest judgement. When Adam and Eve sinned. Even though it was the woman who was tempted, Adam was questioned.

Even though Saul was saying, it was the people who brought the animals, Saul was judged.

If God has placed you in a place of authority, don't think the people will be judged, it is you the leader God will face the most judgement and you will have to give an account.

## 1SA 15:9

They were not willing to destroy ....

It was a matter of will and disobedience. Saul was a people pleaser who would please men rather than God. He feared the people and lost his position.
