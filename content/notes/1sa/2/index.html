<p>By the arm of flesh shall no man prevail. Assyrian was conquering nations and as small nations were taking cover for protection in Egypt under Pharaoh Shabako, Israel was also tempted to do the same and God was warning them but they didn&rsquo;t listen and neither did they want to repent of idolatry.</p>

<p>God has a heart and soul.

<h2 id="1sa-212-1">1SA 2:12</h2>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t train our children to walk in the ways of Lord, they will become rebellious and turn away.they become worthless and unprincipled.</p>
<p>It is good to work for God but we should also take time amidst this for our family to teach and spend time with them and speak and encourage them in the word.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 2:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2613928963416515461">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-29-1">1SA 2:9</h2>
<p>Not by might or power but by the Holy Spirit. God has control over everything even though Satan is the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4)</p>
<p>Satan has his right and rule over the children of disobedience who are not yet saved but has no power over the children of God. He could however ask for permission but God decides and if God says go on, God will provide a way out for us.</p>
<p>100% of the time, the answer is in the word of God the bible if only we can turn to it. The Holy Spirit is also there to guide us.</p>

<p>Punishment for treating God&rsquo;s offering with contempt
God was to take a share before anyone but these servants wants to take the first and the best.</p>
<p>They treated God&rsquo;s offerings anyhow and it made people abhor God&rsquo;s offerings. God punished them with untimely death even though it took time before God finally gave his final verdict.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we continue doing wrong because we feel God don&rsquo;t act or is blind to our sins.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes 8:11 - Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 2:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2612697067877556547">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-217-1">1SA 2:17</h2>
<p>Treating the offering of God disrespectfully is a sin. Lord forgive and gave mercy on me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how small or big it is, it needs to be treated with care just as we would treat the things of our boss respectfully.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 2:17. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2612630684007391350">notes</a></p>
