<p>Naval insulted David by implying he is a runaway slave even though David and his men had been watching over his sheep. at least he should not have said anything and Nabal must have known that David was a potential king.</p>
<p>The day of joy in sheep shearing almost turned to a day of woe and mourning</p>

<h2 id="1sa-2522">1SA 25:22</h2>
<p>Death and life are in the power of the tongue.</p>
<p>The words we speak carry powers that can either build up or destroy. Examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rebecca - Said the curse on Jacob be on her, she also wished she had died in Genesis 28 and died 7 chapters later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter rained curses on himself when denying Jesus 3 times but Jesus after his resurrection made him renounce his statement when he asked Peter if he loved him thrice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saul cursed himself and his son when he demanded a fasting until the Philistines were destroyed in the day of battle in 1 Samuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are many more examples like when David pronounced judgement of death on the offender on himself unknowingly after God sent the prophet Nathan to him who used a parable to explain what evil David had done) after he killed Uriah and married Bathsheba. God had mercy on David. He didn&rsquo;t die but he lost some children (Bathsheba&rsquo;s son, Amnon, Absalom)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case of David, David rained curses on his enemies instead of himself. He would have died if he directed it to himself as we will see later that Nabal and Saul died.</p>
<p>Be careful what you say. It is better to say nothing than say destructive words</p>

<p>David had just mourned the death of Saul and somewhere in town, another wealthy man named Nabal was having a festive period. A time to sheer his sheep, a time of produce that would surely bring in more money.</p>
<p>David heard of Nabal&rsquo;s celebration and sent servants to visit Nabal so they can share in his joy but unfortunately, Nabal rained abuses on David&rsquo;s servant and David became furious.</p>
<p>Perhaps this rich man was proud, he had forgotten David the giant killer who saved Israel from the philistines and gave peace to the land. He probably also knew David was an anointed King</p>
<p>If Nabal was stingy. Al least he could have done that in a better way than insult the soon to be King. David&rsquo;s intentions were good, even sending blessings to the rich man s home</p>
<p>David became furious and spoke in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!?</p>
<p>Abigail, Nabal&rsquo;s wife on the other hand was intelligent, had good judgement and beautiful. When she was told what Nabal had done, she hosted to prevent the calamity proclaimed on Nabal&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>This woman was wise and knew what to do. She recognised who David was in the sense that he was a King and treated him the normal way Nabal should have done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned by Abigail&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>First she bowed down to David as a sign of respect, then begged(inter-seeded for Nabal)  then</p>
<ol>
<li>Prayed for David</li>
<li>Through her prayer, it was obvious somehow that she knew David will be King, and she knew all about God&rsquo;s promises to David.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I wonder that Nabal should be aware of this too but unfortunately for him he chose to treat David with disdain and in the end he lost his life, his wife and whatever thing he could lose.</p>
<p>Nabal finally died but Nabal must be very wicked and  stingy. He was shocked because Abigail made the right choice.</p>
<p>Lessons</p>
<ol>
<li>Be cheerful to give - (All these wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if Nabal had given in the first place).</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t give, at lest have soothing words</li>
<li>Make things right as soon as possible otherwise disaster can come upon you</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be rash in speaking (Nabal didn&rsquo;t think twice, he just blasted David&rsquo;s servants. David was also rash in speaking and taking someone&rsquo;s life)</li>
<li>Always listen to advice (Even though David had authority, he still listened to Abigail&rsquo;s advice)</li>
</ol>
