## 1SA 2:35

God has a heart and soul. He would raise up a faithful priest. perhaps Eli wasn't faithful in his service to God because of the way his sons treated with contempt God's offering causing people to lose faith in God and difficult to offer sacrifice for sins, thanksgiving, atonement and various other things.
