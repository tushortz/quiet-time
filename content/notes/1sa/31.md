## 1SA 31:12

Irrespective of how rebellious or ungodly you are, doing good in the past will help you one day. Saul had previously helped the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead when Nahash the ammonite came against them.

This time, they repaid Saul's kindness by giving him a decent burial instead of a shameful one by getting his body from the wall of Beth-Shan (the Philistines intention was for people passing by to Mock Saul and Israel as people passed by) and hail their gods
