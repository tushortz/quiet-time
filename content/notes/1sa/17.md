## 1SA 17:37

this should be my confession. if God has saved me many times from death, he will surely rescue me whenever I am in trouble

## 1SA 17:18

David had been anointed as king for war but was still feeding the sheep and delivering cheese. he was still an errand boy until the Holy Spirit moved his father to send him on delivery. this marked a milestone for his future.

At the right time God will elevate me. I just need to remain faithful to the things I've been asked to do
