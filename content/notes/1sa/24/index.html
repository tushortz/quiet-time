<p>There&rsquo;s very much in common with ancient Israel and the Yorubas. it might be possible that the Yorubas maintained a lot of the cultural aspect of long ago. As I read the Bible more and more it becomes more apparent</p>

<p>3000 best fighters just for David and 600 men. The  anointing will make me wild</p>

<p>Opportunity to be blessed by the king. In doing good in return for evil, David received blessings instead of curses.</p>

<h2 id="1sa-2414">1SA 24:14</h2>
<p>David was so anointed that it took Saul 3000 other skilful and well-trained army all around Israel to come around looking for David and his 600 men and they were not even able to find him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile later, we see that Ahithophel said he needed 12000 men to pursue after David to kill him.</p>
<p>The anointing on David don&rsquo;t wane as he grew older, instead it grew stronger and stronger</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 24:14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2636243490740887677">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-2412">1SA 24:12</h2>
<p>Leaving judgement in God&rsquo;s hands rather than revenging.</p>
<p>If David had killed Saul, he would have been labelled a murderer as he was also accused later on by Shimei</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 24:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2636240875651063931">notes</a></p>

<h2 id="1sa-249">1SA 24:9</h2>
<p>Apart from Saul&rsquo;s fear, hatred and jealousy for David his servant, Saul was also listening to the words of people who are pouring petrol on the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: 1 SAMUEL 24:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2636239161942335607">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="1sa-244">1SA 24:4</h2>
<p>As leaders, we should be careful not to let the people under us influence us to do the wrong things because they misinterpreted prophecy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s prophecy would never inspire us to do wrong. Afterwards, David&rsquo;s conscience smote him.</p>
<p>Even though Saul has been rejected as a King, God still let him rule till he was 72 years. He had to complete his tenure as a King. David also had to be patient. If he had killed Saul, he would have been guilty and God would have dealt with him.</p>
<p>If he killed Saul, he would have actually been a rebel as he was afterwards accused by Nabal because only rebels usurp authority like Lucifer, Absalom, Reuben, etc and the end of these people is destruction.</p>
