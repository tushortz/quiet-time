## 1SA 24:4

As leaders, we should be careful not to let the people under us influence us to do the wrong things because they misinterpreted prophecy.

God's prophecy would never inspire us to do wrong. Afterwards, David's conscience smote him.

Even though Saul has been rejected as a King, God still let him rule till he was 72 years. He had to complete his tenure as a King. David also had to be patient. If he had killed Saul, he would have been guilty and God would have dealt with him.

If he killed Saul, he would have actually been a rebel as he was afterwards accused by Nabal because only rebels usurp authority like Lucifer, Absalom, Reuben, etc and the end of these people is destruction.
