## 1SA 18:25

Now Saul has instituted something similar that caused the death of Samson both related to marriage and causing offence to the Philistines who originated from the Greeks. they had iron chariots whereas Israel were using a sling, bow and swords as instruments of war.

The dowry (bride price) was senseless because it couldn't be used for its original intent. the bride price was paid by the groom to the father of the bride as compensation for the loss of his daughter and insurance for her support if widowed. (NASB Study Bible note)

## 1SA 18:12

the presence of God with David caused Saul to fear him. It affects Saul more because the Holy spirit left Saul to go to his servant.

All the events led to the buildup of Saul wanting to kill David. the guilt of losing the anointing through disobedience and the ascribing of a greater praise to David, a 17 year old than Saul who was old enough to be his father.

Wisdom makes you prosper, promoted and gain favour from God and men

**Related verses**: 1 SAMUEL 18:5. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2631854209721164026)


## 1SA 18:27

Why would Saul ask for the foreskins of the enemies.  He even asks for 200 of them. 

This may have proved an impossible task but it looks like David was up to the task. 

Something I notice:
1. that would render David unclean
2. It is breaking God's law except if God had another plan
3. It is disgusting and absurd

That should have totally prevented David from carrying out the task but Saul should have known better that David can switch modes. From a harp player, a poet, a musician, an anointed man to a giant killer and a skilful warrior

All these because God was with David.

David had enemies within the gates and outside the gates.

No matter the plans of the enemy, if God is with you, no weapons fashioned against you will prosper. And everything your hand finds to do will prosper too.

**Related verses**: 1 Samuel 18:25-28. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2276155706133176956)


## 1SA 18:13

1. David escaped from Saul's javelin twice (Saved from death)
2. He was promoted  to captain of a thousand (promotion)
3. David's enemy, Saul was afraid of him
4. Victorious in his battles

Because THE LORD WAS WITH HIM

Always try to be a man after God's heart like David and everything will go well with you. In times of trouble he will keep you safe, he will also life you high above your Colleague. To attain this, you must love God and the on.y way to truly love God is obey his commands fully.

**Related verses**: 1 Samuel 18:12-14. See [notes](https://my.bible.com/notes/2274599251718431423)


## 1SA 18:5

David went wherever Saul sent him (Obedience) and he behaved himself wisely(wisdom) and in return he was lifted high and accepted by the majority.

In contrast to Saul who partially obeyed God, his position as King was lost, he also lost God's Holy Spirit and be became obsessed with David's success.


Partial obedience is sometimes worse than disobedience because partial obedience can make you argue that you have obeyed and that in itself causes more and intense commotion at not accepting your mistake.

Be a David and not a Saul.
