## 1SA 5:10

God would not be manipulated to act on my behalf especially when I am living a sinful lifestyle. neither would God share his glory with any other. The ark of God was placed before Dagon to show Dagon's superiority but God struck Dagon and he fell before the ark thus God was showing his superiority.

God also struck the Philistine cities with plagues as he did in Egypt. he first struck their gods then their 5 lords, then the people. At the end, the Philistines had to surrender and shamefully return the ark. Prior to this, they were passing the ark around like a hot potato.

It was a similar situation in Egypt. God struck the Egyptian god's, then pharaoh then his people.

I believe the current Corona virus epidemic happening is a judgement on our evil world and because God's presence is going to be very felt really well soon in the countries where the virus has the most impact. e.g. China, Italy, Spain etc.
