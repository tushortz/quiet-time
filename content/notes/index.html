        <p>
            REV 21:3 Our final destination isn&rsquo;t in heaven because we were made of earth and Jesus would set up his kingdom on earth in Revelation. This verse is speaking of inheriting the earth in the time when Jesus comes not now that we die. We will have a new heaven and a new earth.
Abraham is an example of someone who has been promised the earth and his seeds too. This means that if we live according to this verse we too will inherit the earth as Abraham did.

        <p>
            ISA 14:11 Sheol (Hades) or the place of the dead is below the earth according to spiritual geography. It shows that when men die they go down immediately. Jesus also died and went to hell because the scripture says that he went and preached to the dead.
Lazarus and the rich man was also in hell. The difference is that Lazarus was in paradise whereas the rich man was in hell.
