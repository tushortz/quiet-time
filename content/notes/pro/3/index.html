<p>I find favour in the sight of God and man because of the three qualities: mercy, kindness and truth.</p>
<p>mercy and truth because God desires both and kindness in judgement will make me show compassion. God is full of compassion</p>

<h2 id="pro-31">PRO 3:1</h2>

<p>Divine wisdom</p>
<ul>
<li>makes you Wealthy</li>
<li>famous</li>
<li>builds you a house</li>
<li>honoured</li>
</ul>
<p>Solomon even though very wise, his wisdom was turned to foolishness because he disobeyed God in his latter days. He forfeited long life.</p>
<p>He disobeyed the laws of Deuteronomy 17:16-20 which warned kings not to multiply horses, increase silver and gold, multiply wives. The warning was that having many wives would turn his heart away from God.</p>
<p>I believe he became proud because of his fame and stopped reading and acting on the word of God given to the kings to read, learn and observe.</p>
<p>We are made to know according to Deuteronomy 17:19-20 that learning and observing the word of God will make us humble. Meaning no one is above learning at the school of the word of God.</p>
<p>The book of Proverbs also warned us not to give our strength to women because they destroy kings (Proverbs 3:1-3). Solomon the wisest man before Jesus was destroyed, Samson the strongest man portrayed in the bible was destroyed.</p>
<p>If the strongest and the wisest were destroyed, then we must be on guard.</p>
<p>At the end of it all. The wisdom, knowledge, understanding, fame, wealth, women and glory. All without God was vanity and vexation of spirit</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Deuteronomy 17:19-20, 1 Kings 10:28, 1 Kings 11:1-6, Proverbs 3:1-3. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2652894640659489042">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="pro-324">PRO 3:24</h2>
<p>Divine wisdom guarantees peace that surpass all understanding.</p>

<h2 id="pro-315">PRO 3:15</h2>
<p>Wisdom surpasses anything a human being can ever need and only God gives skillful and godly wisdom</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Proverbs 3:15. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3617525904224019117">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="pro-314">PRO 3:14</h2>
<p>Wisdom will give life, it will produce wealth, it will give all that a man can ever need but it comes with restrictions and walking in the way of holiness, judging fairly. Walking like Jesus on the face of the earth</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Proverbs 3:14. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3617525393248739995">notes</a></p>
