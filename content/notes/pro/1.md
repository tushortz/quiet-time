A man's life does not consist of the things he possess. - Luke 12:15 

Jesus Christ warns us to beware of greed. The book of proverbs also warns us. Greed will on,y lead us to both physical and spiritual death. Wanting to possess worldly goods by all means at all cost will make us more selfish and lose focus on God's plan for our lives.
