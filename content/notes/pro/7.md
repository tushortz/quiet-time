## PRO 7:26

What a great comparison between the Proverbs 7 woman e.g. Delilah and the Proverbs 31 woman e.g. Ruth

The Proverbs 7 woman is an immoral woman given to sensual pleasures. Her work is to seek out men who would satisfy her desire even though she was already married. She went for the youth. The inexperienced. In every corners and marketplace unashamed.

Contrast the Proverbs 31 woman who was already married and was focused on helping her household become the best it can be. Helping to build her home
