## PRO 2:4

Seeking the knowledge of God as if mining gold is the criteria to finding wisdom. it's not easy to get treasures and neither is it easy to know God. only those who knows the value of knowing God will seek him.

once we find God, God willbimpart to us his wisdom because we seek him on the basis of his word and the more we know his word, the more we start to become acquainted with him and can know what steps to take if in a dilemma. we would take the same approach he would have taken when we know him.

reverence for God and seeking him is the essence of wisdom
