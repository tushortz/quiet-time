## MAT 9:25

The supposed mourners were laughing at Jesus when he said the girl was not dead. Not everyone have true sympathy. Most are just for a show but Jesus sympathises with us.

Jesus actually left the place of the feast at Matthew?s house while they were eating and drinking to come and raise from the dead the daughter of the official. What a Jesus.

It was after they had sent the crowd outside that Jesus went in and performed the miracle. What is it crowding your heart that prevents Jesus from coming in? Give Jesus the chance in your life and he will turn the situation around.

## MAT 9:21

Faith comes with information. The little information we acquire will make a major impact on our life. I?m sure she had heard about the Lord?s healing power and it had developed faith in her.

Back in the Old Testament, the priests were commanded to teach the people (Leviticus 10:11, Deuteronomy 33:10, Malachi 2:7-8) and anoint the sick or leprous with oil (Leviticus 14:14-19) and they will be cleansed. Jesus was functioning in the role of a priest and he is indeed the great high priest

## MAT 9:21

The robe of the anointed can also be soaked in the healing anointing as we also saw with Peter?s shadow and Paul?s handkerchief.

As far as the examples I?ve seen, faith was used when healing is needed without physical contact with the anointed.
