## MAT 12:42

Jesus claims to be greater than Solomon. Solomon said he did everything possible but found that all was vanity. Jesus didn't built earthly structures but focused on the Kingdom of our father in heaven. He operates in divine wisdom. 

The queen of Sheba is mentioned as the queen of the south
