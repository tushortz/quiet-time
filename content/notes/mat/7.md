## MAT 7:25

The whirlwind is a sign of divine judgement. it affects everything and anything not built on a solid foundation is carried away. Likewise, the wicked are blown away like chaff before the wind but the righteous has a solid foundation because they keep the word of God (Jesus) and are made righteous and are guided to the path of righteousness

## MAT 7:24

The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me. 

I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that's another level.

Jesus already promised he's with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.

Obeying Jesus words confers upon me divine wisdom because of his saying in Matthew 7:24 of the two house builders and their foundation.

## MAT 7:8

The burden is not on God to give but on us to ask and persist in asking. Things of no value can be gotten easily but it takes more effort to get things of high value, the higher the effort in relation to the higher the value of what is being asked for would be directly proportional to how long it will take to get it.

I learned many years ago that persistence can break the strongest of resistance. Back then it was actually true and then I heard it again.

Now I know I have to apply it in the things of God. Our level of relationship with God will also determine how easy we get things. If it?s just for us to lavish things and get famous, I don?t think God will give us what we ask for.

Asking the right things is another key to getting things from God.
