## MAT 7:25

The whirlwind is a sign of divine judgement. it affects everything and anything not built on a solid foundation is carried away. Likewise, the wicked are blown away like chaff before the wind but the righteous has a solid foundation because they keep the word of God (Jesus) and are made righteous and are guided to the path of righteousness
