## MAT 6:25

Life is not about food and drinks and neither is the body about clothes to wear. this is the desire of the earthly and carnally minded man.

This is why when people humbled themselves and wanted to draw closer to God, they removed the distractions by fasting and putting on rags (sackcloth) as a sign of mourning

You don't know the future. There is no need to boast. Just trust in God and do not worry for the days trouble is enough of itself.

Instead seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and every other things (that people are dying for, going to jail for) will be added unto you
