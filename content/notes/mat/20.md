## MAT 20:15

I must be generous because God is generous. He saw that these last workers were idle not because they were lazy but they were unlucky to have not been hired then he decided to hire them for the same price.

I must not be jealous because others are treated better than me. We all have different walk with God but he chooses whom he favours.
