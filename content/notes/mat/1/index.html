<p>Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.</p>
<p>Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it. The name was from God but it had to be made legal on earth through the words of a man.</p>
<p>it is legal to name something you built or brought forth so Joseph needed to remain with Mary so he could name Jesus legally</p>

<h2 id="mat-121-1">MAT 1:21</h2>
<p>Jesus main aim was to save people from their sins. The sin which leads to death and eternal separation from God and a life of everlasting punishment.</p>
<p>Even the meaning of his bane reflects his purpose. Because Jesus was winless, it was impossible for the devil to have a foothold on him</p>

<h2 id="mat-121-2">MAT 1:21</h2>
<p>Jesus name was divinely appointed even before he was born. Everything about Jesus was planned already.</p>
<p>Only Mary was informed about God&rsquo;s plan and until Joseph decided to take a decision contrary to God&rsquo;s plan did an angel of the Lord appear to him.</p>
<p>Jesus assignment was to save people from their sins and that is what his name means (Saviour).</p>
<p>God must know sin is very deadly otherwise there will be no need for Jesus to come into the world</p>
