## MAT 1:21

Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.

Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn't name Jesus so a man had to do it. The name was from God but it had to be made legal on earth through the words of a man.

it is legal to name something you built or brought forth so Joseph needed to remain with Mary so he could name Jesus legally
