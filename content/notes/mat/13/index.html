		<h2 id="mat-1344">MAT 13:44</h2>
<p>David made preparations to build the temple but the site where it was to be built was not known but through the pestilence, the site where Solomon was to build it was revealed and David bought it from the hands of a Jebusite.</p>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field - Matthew 13:44</p>

<h2 id="mat-1341">MAT 13:41</h2>
<p>For the angels to GATHER THEM OUT, it means that they were already inside the kingdom. So I&rsquo;ll do more research on this</p>

<p>I will get more of what I value and less of what I don&rsquo;t value</p>

<p>the kingdom of God is worth more than everything I ever had.</p>

<p>A period of inactivity and spiritual apathy was a great chance for the devil to sow tares among the good seeds.</p>
<p>God help me not to be complacent</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 13:25. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3216011854460215495">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1329">MAT 13:29</h2>
<p>The man - Jesus. 
The wheat - Children of God (saved) 
The tares (weeds resembling wheat) - Unrepentant evil doer
Enemy - devil
Reapers - Angels
Field - The world
Barns - Heaven
Harvest time - End of the world</p>
<p>God didn&rsquo;t allow his servants to take actions of judgement against the unrepentant Sinners but postponed judgement till harvest time.</p>
<p>Also it wasn&rsquo;t for his servants but it was his angels to take the task of gathering the tares and throwing them away to be burned.</p>
<p>Tares look very similar to what&rsquo;s but the difference is apparent when it&rsquo;s fully matured.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 13:24-30. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3216007761457045621">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1344-1">MAT 13:44</h2>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is worth everything you ever owned. It is a treasure hidden and unknown to many. It should be something of great joy if you value your salvation. Everything is worth losing to follow Christ</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 13:44. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2838518444906504761">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1332">MAT 13:32</h2>
<p>These are my interpretations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus is the seed buried in the earth, despised and rejected and after his was raised from the dead, he became Lord of all so that all nations would worship him and he will save many.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus is the vine and we are the branches and we find shelter in him. People also find shelter in pastors connected to Jesus the Christ</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>the word of God is the seed. (Jesus is also the word of God). When the word of God is preached, it may look like it didn?t accomplish much but it is powerful enough to change a person?s life.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I prefer the first interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 13:32. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2834919250769732472">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1329-1">MAT 13:29</h2>
<p>God is so careful with just one wheat that not even one must be lost. We are the wheat in this scenario and one person is worth everything with God. One soul is very important that uprooting was not even allowed even though the tares will slow down the growth of the wheat.</p>
<p>One wheat (person) is of more value to God than everything in the world combined. God so loved us that his worth for one person is his own life.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 13:29. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2834913730394579796">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1346-1">MAT 13:46</h2>
<p>What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but lose his own soul.</p>
<p>Just like the merchant sold all he had to possess this pearl of great price, we should be able to give up everything to walk with God and prevent us losing our soul.</p>
<p>It can also be likened to Jesus giving up everything and laying down his life to purchase redemption for the church.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:46. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2511577516637675894">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1339">MAT 13:39</h2>
<p>Jesus sowed good seeds. The devil sowed bad seeds, although the weeds will affect the growth of the wheat. Some will die, some will grow up and produce fruit but it was confirmed that they all grew up till the time of harvest. Uprooting the evil ones will affect the good ones that&rsquo;s why they waited till harvest time till the evil ones were cast into fire</p>
<p>By their fruit you will know them. Jesus planted good seeds. The devil planted bad seeds.</p>
<p>At the end of the age, the angels will gather the children of the kingdom (good seeds bearing fruit)</p>
<p>Jesus will send out his angels and they will remove everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</p>

<h2 id="mat-1335">MAT 13:35</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God and its parables has been kept secret from the foundations of the world that was why no man could understand it except Jesus explained to them. Now the Holy Spirit helps us and reveals everything to us. SUCH A GREAT AND LOVELY TEACHER</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:35. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2509405278266187909">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1331">MAT 13:31</h2>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is sown by the word of God. If planted on good soil of the heart, it brings forth much fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2508690228312268828">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-138">MAT 13:8</h2>
<p>Th four types of seeds were sown: wayside, rocky placed, among thorns and on good grounds.</p>
<p>Only one of the four produced abundant crops. Don&rsquo;t lose hope when three didn&rsquo;t do well because the one that bore fruits bore up to 30, 60 and 100 times to cover up for the loss.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2508682149990490113">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1323">MAT 13:23</h2>
<p>We need to understand or make people understand the word of God so that it can be fruitful in the person&rsquo;s heart. Thus in turn produces fruits</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:23. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2506515527271965609">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1315">MAT 13:15</h2>
<p>Understanding comes by reading the books. You understand with your heart. I.e. Applying your heart to it and it will be part of you.</p>
<p>As long as your heart is in it, you will do well.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 13:15. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2506509673441256353">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-1319">MAT 13:19</h2>
<p>The enemy of the word is lack of understanding</p>

<h2 id="mat-1344-2">MAT 13:44</h2>
<p>Deep search. There are a lot of things hidden by God and those who dig deep into God gets the treasure.</p>
<p>We are to reign as kings with Christ and it is to our glory to search our the things hidden in the Holy Spirit</p>
