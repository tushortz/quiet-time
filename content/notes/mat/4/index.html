		<h2 id="mat-412">MAT 4:12</h2>
<p>If John had not baptised Jesus at this time, Jesus would not have been able to get baptised as we can see now that John was put in prison and Jesus needed to go for 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted. Speed is a determinant</p>

<h2 id="mat-411">MAT 4:11</h2>
<p>Angels brought Elijah food which powered him for 40 days and 40 nights journey. this was the same with Jesus</p>

<h2 id="mat-44">MAT 4:4</h2>
<p>The manna ceased but the law lasted forever. Man cannot live forever by eating bread or manna but man will have everlasting life if he abides by the word of God.</p>
<p>both manna and the commandments were given by God yet one was more important than the other.</p>
<p>The commandments lasted generations but the manna didn&rsquo;t even though both were provided by God. it goes to show that the spiritual is greater than the natural. this was what made the difference between Moses and Joshua vs the Israelites.</p>

<h2 id="mat-47">MAT 4:7</h2>
<p>God has the power to do the impossible but we must not put ourselves in intentional situations that warrant us to be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 4:7. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3266037678508598178">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-44-1">MAT 4:4</h2>
<p>Of the three instances of Jesus temptation, Jesus used the word of God to counter the devil?s speech. The first time, the devil couldn?t succeed and on his second attempt, he quoted scriptures which was very true of the scriptures although it was in a perverted way and Jesus countered it with the right scriptures.</p>
<p>I remember Jesus saying ?Jesus replied, &ldquo;Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? (Matthew 12:24)</p>
<p>so ignorance of the scriptures is not an excuse. Jesus definitely had learnt the scriptures from his childhood days because it couldn?t have been possible for Jesus to only have started learning the scriptures in his 40 days in the wilderness.</p>

<h2 id="mat-417">MAT 4:17</h2>
<p>After Jesus baptism of water and the Holy Spirit, Jesus went to fast (I&rsquo;m sure he also prayed) for 40 days in the wilderness and then he began to preach the same message of repentance (in  Galilee) Jesus had already began preaching before John was taken to prison</p>

<h2 id="mat-412-1">MAT 4:12</h2>
<p>The prophecy of Jacob came to pass in the lives of his children. We need to be careful about what we do to our parents so we don&rsquo;t get cursed.</p>

<h2 id="mat-412-2">MAT 4:12</h2>
<p>Jesus was living in Galilee but went to John in Nazareth to be baptised and stayed there until John the Baptist was arrested</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 4:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2693467500956082205">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-48">MAT 4:8</h2>
<p>The devil tempted Jesus at the point of personal need, point of misusing authority (power) and worldly possessions (fame). Things that don&rsquo;t last long. Like building a sand castle and having all of them washed away when the waves wash it away</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 4:8. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2496799983505498238">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-47-1">MAT 4:7</h2>
<p>The only way Jesus combatted the devil&rsquo;s questions and doubts were through the word of God. Confidence and faith in God&rsquo;s word</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 4:7. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2496799983497109629">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-46">MAT 4:6</h2>
<p>I notice the devil always come with questions that causes doubts and if we succumb to this, we lose on God&rsquo;s blessings and walk in disobedience.</p>
<p>Just as the devil caused Adam&rsquo;s downfall with  a  question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did God say you should not &hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 4:6. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2496799983488721020">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-44-2">MAT 4:4</h2>
<p>Live on every word that comes from God. Not picking and choosing which one suits us because his word is a lamp and a light to guide us even in darkness and every situations in life</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 4:4. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2496799983505498239">notes</a></p>
