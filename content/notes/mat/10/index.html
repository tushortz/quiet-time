<p>God is concerned with the affairs of little things he&rsquo;s created. Even sparrows we classify as worth-less.</p>
<p>This is bringing to attention that we are more than sparrows and God is also concerned about us so we need not worry.</p>

<p>Thinking you are  better than your teacher is a deception especially if you think you can do better than Jesus the Christ and Lord. We can aim to imitate Christ. If they call the master names, we can expect to receive even worse treatment.</p>

<h2 id="mat-1020">MAT 10:20</h2>
<p>We need to be wise as serpent and harmless as doves.</p>
<p>Serpents use the venoms of their mouth to fight. They usually stay hidden and don&rsquo;t waste time on useless things. They don&rsquo;t indulge in useless battles and can only be seen once in a while when they have a purpose. After that, they go back into hiding.</p>
<p>They overcome handicap of not have walking feet, teeth to chew food and some snakes are blind or have minimal use of their eyes. They don&rsquo;t possess outer ears to hear. Although they have complete inner ear structure and this allows them to sense vibrations yet snakes flourish more in many parts of the globe</p>
<p>Doves on the other hand are easy to fly away.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 10:16-20. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2581177151089533259">notes</a></p>

<h2 id="mat-106">MAT 10:6</h2>
<p>Jesus wants the gospel to be preached first to the Jews then the gentiles. It is not meet that the dogs eat before the children. And if the children reject bread, then the dogs can have as many as possible.</p>
<p>This is also to fulfil scripture, &ldquo;I will call them my people who are not my people&rdquo;. - 1 Peter 2:10, Romans 9:25, Hosea 2:23</p>
<p>The work commanded to the apostles and of course Christians is to preach the gospel, signs to accompany is healing the sick, raising the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons.</p>
<p>We are commanded to give freely as we have been given. God gave us his son freely so that we can be saved. Of course there was a price to pay but God gas been very merciful and gracious</p>
