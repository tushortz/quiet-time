## MAT 19:18

The young ruler came with a self-righteous attitude. He had ticked all the boxes when it came to living right with people. He asked what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus said keep the commandments. The commandments dealt with both a relationship with God and with people.

Jesus gave him the commandments that dealt with people and after the young man knew that yes I ticked the box with men, he knew it wasn?t complete because the first four parts  commandments that had to do with God had not been discussed but Jesus pointed out that all those four could be summed up into two. He normally kept the sabbath so that also wasn?t a problem

Not necessarily not worshipping physical idols but what one treasured above God is idolatry.

Jesus summed it up and told him to 
1. Give up what he treasured by selling everything he had and give to the poor
2. Follow him (Jesus) so he could have that personal relationship with God himself who was present physically

## MAT 19:8

It was not the perfect will of God for a divorce but it was God?s permissive will because their hearts were heard.

We fall into God?s permissive will because of hardness of hearts.

## MAT 19:16

Eternal life is not earned by good works. It is a product of our faith in Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins

We are not saved by works for by the works of the law shall no man be justified. Instead we are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:5,8) for good works which God has ordained that we should work in them. (Ephesians 2:10)
