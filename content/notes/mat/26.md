## MAT 26:42

Jesus had said where two or three are gathered in his name, the father would answer the prayers. On this principle, Jesus took Peter, James and John so they could intercede for him not to face the suffering on the cross.

Jesus returned to his disciples to receive confirmation of his answered prayer but the answer was no, they were all sleeping so prayer couldn't be answered. Jesus went the second time after encouraging them to pray and then he saw them sleeping again so answer was no,

He went to pray a third time and received confirmation of his prayer. The cup of suffering would not be taken away from him because he found the disciples sleeping and no one was awake to join in his prayer.

But an Angel came to strengthen him so he could endure the suffering to come.
