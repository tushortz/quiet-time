<p>The same people whom he helped and spent his life to save were taunting him. Lord help us not to be ungrateful</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 27:39. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2864327320117436844">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2737">MAT 27:37</h2>
<p>Even in his death, accusation didn?t stop</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 27:37. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2864325579808432544">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2735">MAT 27:35</h2>
<p>Psalm 22:18 prophecy fulfilled. In fact Psalm 22 is a written version of Matthew 27.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years before Jesus was born. A time when crucifixion didn?t exist, a psalm was written that talked about the suffering of the messiah</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 27:35. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2864324946695020955">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2725">MAT 27:25</h2>
<p>Exactly as Jesus had predicted in Matthew 23:29-36.</p>
<p>Their ancestors had killed the prophets indeed and even though they built nice tombstones for them, their descendants had a doing in the murder and crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
<p>Now the people are unknowingly placing a curse on themselves and their children.</p>
<p>The Jewish people has always been a hated people and have been subject to attacks in history.</p>
<p>Jesus surprisingly had been replaced so that a thief and murderer can be set free and he condemned though he was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 27:25. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2862588541606290015">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2723">MAT 27:23</h2>
<p>Even after Jesus had healed people, raised the dead, cast out demons from people, taught them etc, these people were still the people who said crucify him.</p>
<p>These people he fed, these people he prayed for, these people he cared for.</p>
<p>It was these people that called him master, these people few days ago were shouting hosanna and hailing him as king,</p>
<p>These people called him teacher, these people called him Lord, these people called him Rabbi, these people called him Messiah and king.</p>
<p>Now I know not to be impressed by people?s talk, not to be surprised by people?s actions or to be worried about people?s threats. Only focus on God and his work.</p>
