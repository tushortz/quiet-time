## MAT 5:20

The Pharisees were experts of the law. Thy taught but they don?t practice what thy preached. That is hypocrisy. We are not to do the same otherwise we will end up in hell.

The greatest and First commandment encompasses these things. If we love God, everything else falls in place,

Think about it, the Pharisees hated Jesus that was why they could not accept him and keep his commandments. The loved the law but not the giver of the law. Thinking by what they do, they are justified.
