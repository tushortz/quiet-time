<p>He silenced the Pharisees and muzzled the Saducees. If the group who are most knowledgeable of the scripture can be silenced, who else can?</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 22:46. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3536515904807101127">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2221">MAT 22:21</h2>
<p>It is false balance to do well in God and not in other areas and vice versa.</p>
<p>Jesus used wisdom without offending both parties. Lord I need wisdom</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Matthew 22:21. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3314709440037118492">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="mat-2212">MAT 22:12</h2>
<p>This kinda sounds similar to the story of Anagkazo where those who were invited gave excuses. what is notable here is that the poor, lame, blind and those who were not worthy were invited.</p>
<p>Wedding garments were provided (mist likely robe of righteousness) but unfortunately he decided not to wear his robe and didn&rsquo;t have an answer when he was questioned why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was thrown out into outer darkness. It is not enough for me to make it to the banquet but it is complete when I am dressed in purity and righteousness.</p>
<p>The great banquet sounds like a physical event because there will be bread and wine with people of different languages and nations sat together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. People will also wear clothes and will have emotions because there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: MATTHEW 22:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3221952378924950349">notes</a></p>
