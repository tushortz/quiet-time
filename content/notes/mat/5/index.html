<p>Jesus flipped the punishment. Rather than big sins = big Punishment, Jesus flipped it so something as small as calling someone a fool is enough to take someone to hell because for anyone to be willing to call someone a fool, they must have resented the person in their heart.

<p>Jesus said ?If you love me, keep my commandments?. And his commandments is to love others as our selves.</p>
<p>The greatest and First commandment encompasses these things. If we love God, everything else falls in place,</p>
