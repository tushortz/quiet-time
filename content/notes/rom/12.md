## ROM 12:1

We are told to give our bodies to God. We should be a Holy and LIVING sacrifice and not like the dead sacrifice of old.

We are. Implored to give ourself to God willingly not like the Egyptians who gave themselves as a living sacrifice to Joseph on the basis that they were in problems i.e. no food to eat because the famine had dealt a serious blow on them (Genesis 47:18)
