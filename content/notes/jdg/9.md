## JDG 9:54

Abimelech the son of Gideon and a concubine of Shechem killed his 70 brothers just to be king. The unjust elders also supported him because he was of their clan but revenge cried and in the end Abimelech killed his supporters and he died a disgraceful death. A woman broke his skull but to prevent shame, he told his young armour bearer to kill him.

Leadership gained through betrayal and preference of relationship rather than the right way and reliance on God will always lead to disaster.

The story of judges explains about how Israel chose different leaders for themselves but some succeeded and many failed. How Israel went back to spiritual prostitution and was oppressed and how God used many people to rescue them
