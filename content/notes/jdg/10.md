## JDG 10:8

You can still be oppressed and crushed, broken and distressed in the promised land because you served other gods after being saved and waxed hot God's anger. Not keeping his covenant

God is obligated to keep his part of the covenant as long as you fulfil your dues of the covenant

## JDG 10:16

God is a merciful God. Even though he is always forsaken, he still has a heart for us. If we forsake our idols and serve him, he will bless us, keep us at rest and in peace.

He can't bear our mystery and how we are oppressed so he wants us to cry to him so that he can help us

## JDG 10:6

They even got worse this time, serving 7 gods of the heathen nations God had commanded them.  not to serve. It became a snare for them yet they never learned. 

A separated nation whoring after other gods who could do them no good. This only leads to oppression and distress by the enemy. May God help us

Without the Holy Spirit, we cannot truly obey God.
