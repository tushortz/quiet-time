<p>We need no rely on the arms of flesh because the everlasting arms is ready to help us. The battle was God&rsquo;s and yet he needed men to appear in battle. God had to separate the fearful and unbelieving among the people</p>
<p>God also had to separate the remaining 10000 men into two groups. Those who licked water from cupped hands were allowed to battle.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the battle was won by God and 300 men against an innumerable number of medianite armies</p>
<p>God encouraged Gideon to believe in his word by urging him to go to the enemies camp. There he heard of a man&rsquo;s dream saying God has given the victory to Gideon</p>
<p>To win battles, God has to strengthens and encourages us. He does this by his word. He may also give us signs as well.</p>
