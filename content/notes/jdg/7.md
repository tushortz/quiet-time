## JDG 7:6

We need no rely on the arms of flesh because the everlasting arms is ready to help us. The battle was God's and yet he needed men to appear in battle. God had to separate the fearful and unbelieving among the people

God also had to separate the remaining 10000 men into two groups. Those who licked water from cupped hands were allowed to battle.

In conclusion, the battle was won by God and 300 men against an innumerable number of medianite armies

God encouraged Gideon to believe in his word by urging him to go to the enemies camp. There he heard of a man's dream saying God has given the victory to Gideon

To win battles, God has to strengthens and encourages us. He does this by his word. He may also give us signs as well.
