<p>Even my desires can be used as an occasion by God to bring about his will to pass. the outcome depends on how willing and flowing I can be</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 14:4. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3390109830324412983">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-149">JDG 14:9</h2>
<p>Hi parents didn&rsquo;t know he took honey from a dead lion. Be careful what you eat. It could be sweet but you don&rsquo;t know its source and it will keep you unclean, guilty and impure even though you don&rsquo;t know about it</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 14:9. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2605685173383848799">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-146">JDG 14:6</h2>
<p>It is through empowerment by the spirit of God that we can live victorious lives. David testified of this fact.</p>
<p>By God I have run through troops and leaped over walls.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 14:6. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2605679851860648765">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1416">JDG 14:16</h2>
<p>Beware of manipulative women who put out a show so you can tell them the source of your strength. Never succumb to pressure or you will be shot down.</p>
<p>Samson made several mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>he was a Nazirite but didn&rsquo;t live like one</li>
<li>he was never to touch dead animals but he did</li>
<li>he disobeyed God&rsquo;s commandments never to take other nations for a wife</li>
<li>he was physically strong when empowered by the Holy Spirit but spiritually bankrupt</li>
<li>he rejected counsel from his parents</li>
<li>he had a weakness for wine, pride, unforgiveness and women</li>
<li>he let his feelings dictate rather than the Holy Spirit directing him</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 14:16. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2600413293974380658">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1414">JDG 14:14</h2>
<p>The riddle could be looked in this way:</p>
<p>Out of the philistines came the lady to marry
Out of them came something enjoyable</p>
