<p>Rash vow but he still had to fulfill it. Jephthah may have thought a slave would be the one to welcome him</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 11:31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/3389519865093808847">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1131-1">JDG 11:31</h2>
<p>Perhaps Jephtah would have thought, my slave will come to welcome me so I&rsquo;ll offer him or perhaps if it is a goat of cow but God doesn&rsquo;t want anything less than the best.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 11:31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2600376389962818548">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1134">JDG 11:34</h2>
<p>His only daughter became the sacrifice for the salvation of Israel. He couldn&rsquo;t break his vows to God. Jephtah had to give up the daughter he loved. Sometimes our prayers are answered when we intend to give something to God that is very valuable to us.</p>
<p>Perhaps Jephtah&rsquo;s idol was his child so God was saying, man, its time to get rid of this thing. I&rsquo;m seeing it as a competition</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 11:34-35. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2600374272636216302">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1131-2">JDG 11:31</h2>
<p>God respect vows. He does his part and expects us to do our part as well. We need to be careful and thoughtful when making vows.</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 11:30-31. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2600370736032637925">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-112">JDG 11:2</h2>
<p>Although Jephthah was a bastard and a social outcast, he didn&rsquo;t let that define him and prevent him from fulfilling his destiny. Through the empowerment of God, he was able to overcome his situation and he became both military commander and judge of Israel. He even qualified to have his name mentioned in the Faith&rsquo;s hall of fame in Hebrews 11:32</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 11:2-3. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2600365541118698456">notes</a></p>
<h2 id="jdg-1112">JDG 11:12</h2>
<p>It is evil to worship all other gods. Lifeless and useless gods of wood and stone. It is even a disrespect to move to a useless thing from a great thing, it shows lack of sense and good choice.</p>
<p>God is a jealous God and he will not share his glory</p>
<p><strong>Related verses</strong>: Judges 2:11, Judges 11:12. See <a href="https://my.bible.com/notes/2586132740198621447">notes</a></p>
