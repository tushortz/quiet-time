Beware of manipulative women who put out a show so you can tell them the source of your strength. Never succumb to pressure or you will be shot down.

Samson made several mistakes:
- he was a Nazirite but didn't live like one
- he was never to touch dead animals but he did
- he disobeyed God's commandments never to take other nations for a wife
- he was physically strong when empowered by the Holy Spirit but spiritually bankrupt
- he rejected counsel from his parents
- he had a weakness for wine, pride, unforgiveness and women
- he let his feelings dictate rather than the Holy Spirit directing him
