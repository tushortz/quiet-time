## JDG 8:27

Gideon, an humble man was given victory over the Midianites and decided to humiliate the elders of the city of Succoth for not giving him food when he was weary after pursuing two kings.

Gideon respected the God of Israel and would not rule as king over them. The Israelites are showing signs of disloyalty here in not wanting God to rule over them.

Although, Gideon may have meant creating a golden ephod for good but it became a snare to Israel as they soon began to worship other gods.
