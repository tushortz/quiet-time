This means that all dead people are still somewhere but not in heaven. Probably Hades but in the part of paradise awaiting ressurection.</description>

      <description>ISA 58:5 Fasting is a means of humbling myself. It should also be a time to mourn for my sins and produce a repentant heart (poor in Spirit)
It looks like this fasting was done on the Sabbath because it was the only day that God did not permit work.
Fasting makes my voice heard. Fasting is not just about depriving the body of food even though it&amp;rsquo;s a means of starving the flesh to stuff the Spirit.</description>

      <description>PRO 6:16  Just like Jesus wore the crown of thorns to save us from the wrath and abomination of our heavenly father,  A proud look stems from the heart because it is the attitude that overestimates oneself and discount others.
 Jesus suffered thirst from the tongue  the tongue speaks out lies, deceits and is the agent of false witnesses
 his hands were nailed to the cross his side were pierced (where his heart is located) his feets were pierced  Related verses: Proverbs 6:16-19.</description>

      <description>MAT 1:21 Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.
Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&amp;rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it.</description>

The thief comes to kill, steal and destroy. Jesus came that we may have life.
The word of God is important in discerning good and wise judgement.
this is what happens when Satan brings an accusation before the father but Jesus or his followers petitions the father so that they might not be given over to the will of Satan the evil one</description>

      <description>2CO 4:4 Solomon prayed for an understanding mind and a hearing (obedient heart). Understanding is really important in administer justice as the King and representatives of God.
I as a Christian represent the Lord Jesus and need understanding to obey the words of God. Unless God opens my mind, I may never understand many things that I have been taught. Since my mind needs to be renewed by the word of God, it becomes easier when I pray for God to give me an understanding mind and an obedient heart.</description>

This means that as long as the priest has not entered, there is still grace to save some. The priest represented God to the people and because he carried the anointing, the anointing has not entered the unclean house

      <description>JHN 2:2 Jesus already had disciples when he was invited to the wedding in Cana where he turned the water used for cleansing to wine for drinking and pleasure.
Imagine trying to use water to wash and find wine and you put some in your mouth and it tastes even nicer.
God provided more than enough. Had Jesus not been invited, there would have been shortage of wine.
It looks like it was a great feast and feasts usually lasts 7 days.</description>

      <description>JAS 4:7 I need to submit to God?s word and his authority then resist the devil.
Submission comes before resistance. I must resist evil after I have submitted to God and he will flee from me. My submission to God gives me authority over the devil.
Submission means to place yourself in the control of another.
Just as yielding myself to do evil continually makes the Holy Spirit depart from me so is the same with yielding myself to God.</description>

I have been wondering what apostle Paul was saying but i now I know that after Eve fell from transgression, she also got us the opportunity to be saved through childbearing which happened because a woman also gave birth to a saviour. Although the means of redemption has been provided, everyone still has the responsibility to work out their salvation through faith, love and holiness.</description>

1CO 14:5 Tongues is more useful for personal development and spiritual growth whereas prophecy is leaned towards the body of Christ.

      <description>ISA 26:3 There is peace and there is perfect peace. This can only be given by the prince of peace.
Thesaurus defines peace as freedom of the mind from annoyance, distraction, anxiety, obsession etc.
We can only achieve perfect peace when our mind is focused on Jesus and not of the things of the world. There is always tribulation in the world. We live in a fast paced world that tries us out but focusing on Jesus helps us to discard unnecessary problems that can occur with a mind focused on the world, its fleeting pleasures, fame and glory.</description>

God had used Mordecai and Esther to bring relief to the Jews and salvation to the gentiles. This story of Esther and Mordecai is quite similar to the story of Joseph.</description>

EST 3:9 Evil people don&amp;rsquo;t spend money on themselves and their families. They spend it on evil things. Imagine Haman would rather pay 10000 talents of silver for evil. What a Jezebel of a man to use the King&amp;rsquo;s authority for evil.</description>

      <description>NEH 6:16 Wow I&amp;rsquo;ve come to love Nehemiah. He always thought about God in all he was doing. He never gave up in the face of adversity. When the people was discouraged, he encouraged them in the Lord. When his life was in danger, he never feared but trusted in God.
Finally he attributed completing the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem to help from God.
While many could have said, we used some genius minds, technical capabilities and other big words and in the end our efforts paid off, Nehemiah attributed things to God and didn&amp;rsquo;t take credit for it</description>

      <description>NEH 5:19 Everything Nehemiah did is apparent that he loved God and his people. He did all he could to prevent tauntings from the enemies of the Jews.
He sacrificed many benefits for the good of his people. A good leader can be known by how much he is willing to sacrifice his comfort for the things of God first then his people.
This characteristic is lacking in the part of many leaders of nations.</description>

God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac long ago, it may have been a common practice in the time of Abraham but Abraham was willing to do so not to a demon but to the true God because Hebrews 11 tells us that ABRAHAM BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD.</description>

      <description>JDG 7:10 We need no rely on the arms of flesh because the everlasting arms is ready to help us. The battle was God&amp;rsquo;s and yet he needed men to appear in battle. God had to separate the fearful and unbelieving among the people
God also had to separate the remaining 10000 men into two groups. Those who licked water from cupped hands were allowed to battle.
In conclusion, the battle was won by God and 300 men against an innumerable number of medianite armies</description>

Faithfulness is being constant and independent of circumstance. This is one of the reasons God doesn&amp;rsquo;t good us the full measure of the Holy Spirit.
God will give us little and test us to make sure we are faithful with the little. Then he increase and increase until he can trust us fully.</description>

How to prevent problems assumptions could cause

      <description>1CO 9:27 Be careful with your body and its desires. You are not a superman. You are still a man living in a corrupt body. Renew your mind with the word of God constantly and forget about your desires otherwise you will be brought down.
Forget about your feelings. Focus on the work of God. The time is short.

      <description>EXO 4:4 God was sending Moses to the Israelites but not without signs and wonders. He empowered Moses to do the undoable.
Moses ran away from the staff turned snake but God told him to take the snake by the tail. &amp;lsquo;Who does that&amp;rsquo;. God was directly telling him to confront his fears. God was saying &amp;lsquo;i make the harmless deadly and the deadly harmless.
Second empowerment was turning a healthy hand to a diseased one and a diseased one to a healthy flesh.</description>

      <description>EXO 23:29 God is also considerate of nature irrespective of his spiritual capabilities. Strategic planning is involved here as driving out the Canaanites, Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites, Amorites etc would cause the multiplication of wild animals.
These group of people are also needed to play their role so that the Israelites would in turn enjoy the fruit of their (not Israeli&amp;rsquo;s) labour.

      <description>EXO 13:17 God would not take the Israelites through shortcuts because they were not able to prove their preparation for warfare otherwise they would return back to Egypt, the land of son and bondage. Instead he take them through roundabouts, even though it was long, it was to prepare them carefully for the future and the promises ahead.
They had to be trained and tested so that they can be purified and fit for the promise land</description>

      <description>GEN 46:4 Faith Even though Jacob knew his families were going to suffer in Egypt for 400+ years, he still obeyed God. Even though he didn&amp;rsquo;t live to witness those years of suffering nor did he get the inheritance in his lifetime, he still proceeded into Egypt with his family.
Sometimes, it is God&amp;rsquo;s will that we go through a very difficult time in our life. God has his plan and his reward but are we willing to trust him even though we don&amp;rsquo;t see the big picture or do we want to do it our own way and bear the consequences.</description>

      <description>GEN 44:33 Repentance What a transformation. The Judah that was behind selling Joseph as a slave in times past was now willing to be in place of Benjamin as a servant of Joseph. Great sign of repentance. The brothers of Joseph had come to realise that they acted foolishly are now regretting their past actions
When you repent, it shows in your actions and words

      <description>JHN 13:18 I believe this Psalm was written when he fled from his son Absalom. His trusted friend and counsellor &amp;ldquo;Ahithophel&amp;rdquo; had connived with Absalom in his rebellion. Ahithophel&amp;rsquo;s motive may have been because David slept with his grand daughter &amp;ldquo;BathSheba&amp;rdquo; and had his son&amp;rsquo;s son-in-law Uriah killed in battle.
In those days, Ahithophel&amp;rsquo;s counsel was such that it was likened to when one inquired at the oracles of God (2 Samuel 16:23).</description>

(Babylon was handsome, he had 6 packs, he was built. He had muscles But he fell and is now the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birds.)
If you have multiple sexual partners, you will become the habitation of Devils.
When you have sexual demons enter you, you become disobedient, licentious, rebellious.

If God&amp;rsquo;s standard of righteousness is based on good works then who is the man whose good works will be the dividing line between enough good works and not enough good works.</description>
