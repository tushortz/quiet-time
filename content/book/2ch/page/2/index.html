        <p>
            2CH 6:33 The key here is this. Jews and Gentiles could call upon God?s name. According to Solomon?s prayer.
Jews should face
 the temple when in Jerusalem Jerusalem when outside Canaan  Gentiles
 need to be in Jerusalem and face the temple  Jews had more privilege by right of birth until Jesus died and the veil of the temple was torn.
Elisha saved the soul of Namaan :).

        <p>
            2CH 5:10 The jar of manna and Aaron&rsquo;s budded rod had probably been lost because they were both kept in the ark of the covenant along with the two stone tablets that had the 10 commandments written on it.
It shows that Aaron&rsquo;s rod was not meant to last forever neither was the manna but the commandments of God was to last for eternity.
Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod was for a sign, the manna was for a sign and also for temporary sustenance but the law was everlasting.

        <p>
            2CH 3:1 God also told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on the mountain of Moriah. I wouldn?t be surprised if it was exactly this location that God sent Abraham to perform the sacrifcie.
I checked the NASB Study Bible and it says it was the same spot

            2CH 33:13 God is ever gracious. Even when his temple had been profaned with idols and Manasseh had practiced all manner of abominations, God still heard his prayer.
Many times, it takes a very bad situation before we can humble ourselves and come to God. May God help us all but the good thing is God?s arm is always opened wide to receive us.

            2CH 25:16 Not taking heed of advises especially one sent by God is dangerous. Amaziah shut up the prophet of God when he was sent to warn Amaziah.
Other examples of bad experience after rejecting advices are:
 The prophet told not to eat in Bethel when he warned Jeroboam (1 Kings 13) Rehoboam when advised by Elders to lighten the yoke of the people (2 Chronicles 10:6-8) King Ahab when warned by Micaiah not to go to battle (2 Chronicles 18:14-22) David when advices by Joab not to take a census of the people (1 Chronicles 21:2-7)  Related verses: 2 CHRONICLES 25:16.
