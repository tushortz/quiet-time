      <description>2CH 5:10 The jar of manna and Aaron&amp;rsquo;s budded rod had probably been lost because they were both kept in the ark of the covenant along with the two stone tablets that had the 10 commandments written on it.
It shows that Aaron&amp;rsquo;s rod was not meant to last forever neither was the manna but the commandments of God was to last for eternity.
Aaron&amp;rsquo;s budding rod was for a sign, the manna was for a sign and also for temporary sustenance but the law was everlasting.</description>

      <description>2CH 18:1 That was a terrible mistake. After this Judah could not remain the same again. Intermarrying with the daughter of an idolater, prostitute and witch.
Athaliah, the wife of Jehoshaphat almost destroyed the seed of kingship through Judah and through which the Lord Jesus Christ would come. That would have been a fatal disaster for all of us and we would be damned but thank God he is always in control of things</description>

      <description>2CH 11:16 In the face of adversity is the true content of a person revealed. It was during the division of these two kingdoms that the people who really wanted to seek God left their inheritance in Israel to live in Judah while others could not leave everything they own and would rather worship goat demons that Jeroboam the son of Nebat made.
Israel never remained the same again and this was just a beginning till they finally ended up in Babylon</description>

      <description>2CH 10:7 There is something about kindness that makes people gladly obey you. Unfortunately Rehoboam the son of Solomon was begged to be kind to them and they will serve him forever but he rejected the counsel of the elders who had been with Solomon and took advice from the young men who had grown up with him.
Unfortunately, that was a disastrous decision and he lost control of 10 of the kingdoms because the people rebelled against him.</description>
