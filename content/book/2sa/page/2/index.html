            2SA 14:30 This just explains the character of Absalom. Joan was trying to help him by bringing him back from exile. He was meant to be the next King as the oldest son alive. Because Joab would not come to him, he went and set his field on fire.
I believe it was one of the reason Joab killed him during the war to also revenge his field being set on fire.

        <p>
            2SA 13:13 By raping Tamar, Amnon forfeited his chance to become the next King in Israel. He also forfeited his life and caused Tamar to be disgraced because she would no longer be given in marriage since she had lost her virginity, the sign of her pride as a woman.
Normally Amnon should be executed according to the law but because David did not take any action, Absalom took the law in his hands.

2SA 12:13 David instant repentance led to forgiveness. It looks like God always give one chance before judgement as in the case of:

            2SA 10:3 For lack of good advice, a war started. David had good intentions but evil advice on the part of the counsellor of Hanun the King and his actions led to loss of people&rsquo;s lives.
Cutting of the beard was a sign of mourning as well as ripping of the garment. He in a way mocked the Elders of Israel to show mock mourning but not just that, what was worse is that ripping a garment to the hip was usually a demeaning act done to prisoners of war because their buttocks would be exposed if not their pants

            2SA 8:16 This Jehoshaphat is not to be confused with the other King in later times after David.
Josh attained his position as the commander over the army because he attacked the Jebusites first when David wanted to war with Jebus and they were preventing and taunting him.
