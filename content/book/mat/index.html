Related verses: Matthew 26:55. See notes
MAT 26:44 Jesus had said where two or three are gathered in his name, the father would answer the prayers. On this principle, Jesus took Peter, James and John so they could intercede for him not to face the suffering on the cross.
Jesus returned to his disciples to receive confirmation of his answered prayer but the answer was no, they were all sleeping so prayer couldn&rsquo;t be answered.

Related verses: Matthew 6:12. See notes
MAT 6:25 Life is not about food and drinks and neither is the body about clothes to wear. this is the desire of the earthly and carnally minded man.
This is why when people humbled themselves and wanted to draw closer to God, they removed the distractions by fasting and putting on rags (sackcloth) as a sign of mourning

MAT 3:15 If John had not baptised Jesus at this time, Jesus would not have been able to get baptised as we can see now that John was put in prison and Jesus needed to go for 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted. Speed is a determinant
