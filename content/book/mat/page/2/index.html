            MAT 5:37 It&rsquo;s better to be careful with words and not make false vows before God lest the work of your hands be destroyed.
Simple yes and no is fine to avoid lying
Related verses: Ecclesiastes 5:6, Matthew 5:33-37. See notes
MAT 5:42 Anyone who ignores the poor would suffer. it said he himself would CRY then he would not be heard.
If I love the lord and my neighbour, I&rsquo;ll definitely give to the poor

            MAT 8:10 Knowledge empowers faith. Ignorance and faith don&rsquo;t work together. everyone Jesus healed knew something about God and chose to believe him at his word.
Ignorance is the greatest detriment to faith. without knowledge, it will be difficult to believe
Related verses: Matthew 8:10. See notes
MAT 8:13 This time as well, we see God willing to heal the centurion servant. He was first acknowledged as Lord as with the other leper who got cleaned in the first verse.

            MAT 4:12 If John had not baptised Jesus at this time, Jesus would not have been able to get baptised as we can see now that John was put in prison and Jesus needed to go for 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted. Speed is a determinant

            MAT 7:24 the solid foundation of God&rsquo;s word. it is like a solid rock that the Lord Jesus mentions in Matthew 7:24
Related verses: Proverbs 14:1, Matthew 7:24. See notes
MAT 7:26 The whirlwind is a sign of divine judgement. it affects everything and anything not built on a solid foundation is carried away. Likewise, the wicked are blown away like chaff before the wind but the righteous has a solid foundation because they keep the word of God (Jesus) and are made righteous and are guided to the path of righteousness

        <p>
            MAT 1:21 Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.
Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it.

            MAT 18:19 Jesus had said where two or three are gathered in his name, the father would answer the prayers. On this principle, Jesus took Peter, James and John so they could intercede for him not to face the suffering on the cross.
Jesus returned to his disciples to receive confirmation of his answered prayer but the answer was no, they were all sleeping so prayer couldn&rsquo;t be answered. Jesus went the second time after encouraging them to pray and then he saw them sleeping again so answer was no,

            MAT 13:44 David made preparations to build the temple but the site where it was to be built was not known but through the pestilence, the site where Solomon was to build it was revealed and David bought it from the hands of a Jebusite.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field - Matthew 13:44

            MAT 21:32 At the end of the day, what matters most is the action and not the words. The words and the action = faith.
God is more concerned with repentance which is shown by proofs.
Related verses: Matthew 21:32. See notes
MAT 21:22 Whatever is a strong word. I?m going to believe God for his word today. Is it the will of God? If yes then I?ve got it.

            MAT 19:16 The young ruler came with a self-righteous attitude. He had ticked all the boxes when it came to living right with people. He asked what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus said keep the commandments. The commandments dealt with both a relationship with God and with people.
Jesus gave him the commandments that dealt with people and after the young man knew that yes I ticked the box with men, he knew it wasn?
