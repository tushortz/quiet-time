      <description>MAT 1:21 Joseph needed to name Jesus for Jesus to be legal on earth. everything that God created was given a name and remained under his dominion. everything that was kept under the dominion of man was given a name by man.
Name reveals attributes and personality and Jesus being named by Joseph gave him the personality as saviour. The angels couldn&amp;rsquo;t name Jesus so a man had to do it.</description>
