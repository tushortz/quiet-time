LUK 2:23 I believe the parents of Jesus were poor. The law said anyone who couldn&rsquo;t afford a lamb to redeem the first son that opens the womb should offer a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeon (Leviticus 12:8) and that&rsquo;s exactly what the parents of Jesus did.

            LUK 12:18 The soul is the entity that is judged and that which God requires.
Life and accomplishments and labours without God is vain and useless. God has made sure that we human are dependent beings on him and we cause ourselves problems when we decide to revel against him and live our own lives.
It debased us to live like mere animals as we are without God.

            LUK 22:31 The threshing wheel separates the chaff from the wheat by subjecting the grain to pressure when it is treaded on by both the wheels and the cow threshing the grain.
Satan petitioned God to have Job sifted like wheat but Job&rsquo;s faith did not fail. Satan demanded that Peter would be tested as well but his faith did not fail even when he denied Jesus and went back to fishing.

            LUK 20:4 Baptism is an agreement and outward sign and public declaration of an inner change of mind and heart. Because it is public, it is visible to the public and humbling because people will see you and will know you agree that you are a sinner.
it took humility to be baptised. Christ was humble enough to get baptised. John was baptised from heaven (ordained by God. he was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth).

        <p>
            LUK 24:45 Solomon prayed for an understanding mind and a hearing (obedient heart). Understanding is really important in administer justice as the King and representatives of God.
I as a Christian represent the Lord Jesus and need understanding to obey the words of God. Unless God opens my mind, I may never understand many things that I have been taught. Since my mind needs to be renewed by the word of God, it becomes easier when I pray for God to give me an understanding mind and an obedient heart.

        <p>
            LUK 6:19 This wasn?t even Jesus trying to pray for them. It is power coming from him and healing them as they tried to touch him
Related verses: Luke 6:19. See notes
LUK 6:7 There is usually a stronghold present when someone is filled with dos and donts. It?s usually a sign of bondage and oppression. Lack of the Holy Spirit .
On the other hand a lack of self control is also a sign of the presence of demons.

            LUK 5:33 That was an indirect insult to Jesus that he didn?t teach his disciples well and also since he was an irresponsible party goer it was clear that his disciples would be the same as well as his circles of sinners
Related verses: Luke 5:33. See notes
LUK 5:30 The good thing is that Jesus was thinking and not just blinded by religious dos and don?t. Unfortunately many Christians stopped using their brains when it comes to the issue of faith.
