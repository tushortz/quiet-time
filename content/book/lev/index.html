            LEV 11:3 The progression from Genesis 2 where God created man and animals and instructed them to eat plants until their fall.
After the flood, some plants would have taken time to develop but God now accepted me San to eat of any and every animal not mentioning clean or unclean until the time of Moses.
How did Noah know the clean and unclean animals to pick because we only found out about it in exodus but Abraham had already been sacrificing clean animals even in the time of Abel they probably knew what was clean and unclean.

        <p>
            LEV 16:13 the purpose of the incense and the fire was to create a cloud of smoke which would then cover the mercy seat so that the high priest would not come into direct eye contact with God when he sprinkles the blood on the mercy seat. this is because the glory of God will be manifested

            LEV 10:9 I think Aaron?s sons may have been under the influence of alcohol when they went to offer fire to God. It may have impaired their ability to think properly. In this scenario, they were setting a bad example and if God had not intervened, the people would have thought it was normal.
