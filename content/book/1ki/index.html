            1KI 13:18 the prophet lied to the man of God than an angel had appeared to him to I form the man if God to go back and eat (thus contradicting the instructions that God gave the man of God).
no angel or man should be able to make me disobey the clear words given to me by God.

            1KI 12:7 Leadership starts with humility and servanthood. Rehoboam listened to the wrong advice and lost most of the kingdom.
The people weren&rsquo;t interested in being completely free. All they asked for was the burden to be lighter but Rehoboam in his foolishness lost the people&rsquo;s support by being unreasonable
Related verses: 1 Kings 12:7. See notes
1KI 12:27 Doubt can rob us of God&rsquo;s promises. Even though God had elevated Jeroboam and have made him king of Israel and made a covenant to obey God, he decided to make the Israelites serve calves as they did before in the wilderness after they went away from Egypt.

            1KI 4:15 The name sounds Egyptian. she&rsquo;s probably the daughter of the Egyptian woman he married.
Basemath doesn&rsquo;t sound like an Israeli name. it may be possible, another daughter of Solomon&rsquo;s foreign wives

            1KI 8:63 wooow that was a lot of sacrifices. Sacrifices release power no wonder the priests could not even enter the temple to minister because of the intense presence of God (the cloud)
Related verses: 1 Kings 8:63. See notes
1KI 8:54 One of the postures of prayer is to kneel down with hands stretched to heaven. Another is standing, sitting or lying down. I believe that this is the basis for which Muslims do their prayer.

            1KI 7:14 Hiram was filled with the spirit of wisdom, understanding and skill so he was eligible to build the temple of God. It is worth noting that the writer of Chronicles found it worthy to mention that he had a maternal connection with the Israelites
