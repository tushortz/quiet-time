            JDG 21:25 The absence of a king or a great leader gives rise to chaos in a society. When people are allowed to do what they think is right in their own eyes without respect for God and his law, destruction and all sorts of evil is bound to happen.
Had the men of Benjamin respected God&rsquo;s law in the first place, the Levite&rsquo;s concubine would not have been molested leading to death of tens of thousands and kidnapping.
