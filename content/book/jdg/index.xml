      <description>JDG 2:22 The reason God didn&amp;rsquo;t fully drive out the people of the pagan nations in times of Joshua was to test their loyalty

God will give us little and test us to make sure we are faithful with the little. Then he increase and increase until he can trust us fully.</description>
