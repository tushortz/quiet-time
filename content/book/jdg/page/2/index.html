            JDG 13:5 Instructions were given to Samson&rsquo;s mother but wasn&rsquo;t given about Samson who is to be born.

            JDG 7:10 We need no rely on the arms of flesh because the everlasting arms is ready to help us. The battle was God&rsquo;s and yet he needed men to appear in battle. God had to separate the fearful and unbelieving among the people
God also had to separate the remaining 10000 men into two groups. Those who licked water from cupped hands were allowed to battle.
In conclusion, the battle was won by God and 300 men against an innumerable number of medianite armies

            JDG 4:24 God can use anything and anybody. The war wasn&rsquo;t won by power of 10000 armies but by the hand of a woman who was not a warrior.

        <p>
            JDG 2:22 The reason God didn&rsquo;t fully drive out the people of the pagan nations in times of Joshua was to test their loyalty
Faithfulness is being constant and independent of circumstance. This is one of the reasons God doesn&rsquo;t good us the full measure of the Holy Spirit.
God will give us little and test us to make sure we are faithful with the little. Then he increase and increase until he can trust us fully.
