      <description>JOS 22:11 Beware of assumptions. Don&amp;rsquo;t act on it.
How to prevent problems assumptions could cause
 They sent a priest (intercessor) 11 elders (men capable of making wise judgements) called the opposing party Explained their opinion and gave the opposing team chance to talk as well case understood, matters settled, case dismissed no war  Assumptions could have caused a trivial or national war because the Reubenites, Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh and the rest of Israel because these three tribes fought for their brothers until they possessed the land ad now assumptions could have lead to war.</description>

      <description>JOS 21:44 God fulfilled all his promises from the time of Abraham even until Joshua.
God is faithful but we are not receiving anything because of our disobedience or we are not playing our part of the covenant.

Things God did
 gave them all the land (habitation) gave them rest (peace) handed all their enemies over to them (overcomer) fulfilled all part of his covenant  Related verses: JOSHUA 21:43-45.</description>

      <description>JOS 20:6 God has provided a way by right we must be saved from our sins. It is up to us to run to Jesus, our city of refuge. These city of refuge were only for those who committed murder unintentionally whether stranger or native Israelite. Since Jesus our high priest has offered the sacrifice of sins once and for all, we are discharged and acquitted indefinitely and since he ever liveth to make intercession for us, we are saved and forgiven of our sins.</description>

      <description>JOS 10:25 The Lord has put his feet on the neck of our enemies.
This reminds me of Psalm 110:1 - the Lord says to my Lord, sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies at your feet. Jesus is sitting with the father and until the church which is the body of Christ trample Satan under our feet. Jesus has already won the victory and now we need to enforce it.</description>

      <description>JOS 5:9 Named after the new generations were circumcised removing the foreskin of their private part. A removal of the old and an appearance of the new.
This involved shedding of blood. The Old Testament also involved shedding of blood.
Removing the old self and putting on a new self. Old things have passed away. All things become new.
Circumcision also means: May it be done to you as this foreskin (cut off from the rest) if you do not obey the commandments of God</description>
