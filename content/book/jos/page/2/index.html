            JOS 13:1 Take as much as you can and as much as you strength can carry because the supply is not limited. God is a God of war.

            JOS 12:1 31 kings in all had to be defeated before Israel got to the promised land. What are the 31 kings in your life that needs to be destroyed?
It took years but Joshua was obedient and didn&rsquo;t give up until they had taken the promised land.
Don&rsquo;t give up, keep seeking after God. Don&rsquo;t give up

            JOS 11:19 The Hivites living in Gibeon were wise in the sense that they made peace with Israel and were not destroyed.
The others however already knew God was giving Israel victory and still went on to wage war against them.
Be a man of peace. Rahab did similar, she made peace with the men of Israel and was not destroyed

            JOS 10:25 The Lord has put his feet on the neck of our enemies.
This reminds me of Psalm 110:1 - the Lord says to my Lord, sit here at my right hand until I put your enemies at your feet. Jesus is sitting with the father and until the church which is the body of Christ trample Satan under our feet. Jesus has already won the victory and now we need to enforce it.

            JOS 9:14 It is always good to hear from God before making any treaty. It could look good to be friends but it could be a friendship based on deception. This robbed Israel of their blessings. The land of Gibeah which were meant to be taken could not be taken because of the treaty they had made

            JOS 5:9 Named after the new generations were circumcised removing the foreskin of their private part. A removal of the old and an appearance of the new.
This involved shedding of blood. The Old Testament also involved shedding of blood.
Removing the old self and putting on a new self. Old things have passed away. All things become new.
Circumcision also means: May it be done to you as this foreskin (cut off from the rest) if you do not obey the commandments of God
