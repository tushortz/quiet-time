      <description>REV 21:3 Our final destination isn&amp;rsquo;t in heaven because we were made of earth and Jesus would set up his kingdom on earth in Revelation. This verse is speaking of inheriting the earth in the time when Jesus comes not now that we die. We will have a new heaven and a new earth.
Abraham is an example of someone who has been promised the earth and his seeds too. This means that if we live according to this verse we too will inherit the earth as Abraham did.</description>

      <description>REV 20:12 There is no reproduction in heaven. Angels don&amp;rsquo;t marry. When they rise from the dead? We know that not everyone has risen from the dead except for Jesus because everyone else who was raised from the dead died again. We are still awaiting our ressurected body.
This means that all dead people are still somewhere but not in heaven. Probably Hades but in the part of paradise awaiting ressurection.</description>

When you have sexual demons enter you, you become disobedient, licentious, rebellious.
