      <description>EST 10:3 Just like Joseph was, Mordecai was also second in command to the king of a heathen nation. He was also great and the reason for his greatest us described.
Because he worked for the good of his people and spoke for the welfare and peace of his nation.
There is no need to be jealous or angry. When you are in power, you can&amp;rsquo;t use it for evil or you will be destroyed.</description>

      <description>EST 9:4 Godliness gains you greatness, respect and fame.
We look for these three things in the wrong places but true godliness, respect and fame can only be found when we are into our heavenly father&amp;rsquo;s business as the Lord Jesus did.
&amp;ldquo;I must work the works of him that sent me&amp;rdquo; - John 9:4

      <description>EST 8:17 God can make a bad thing good and he did. God never forsook his people even in the land of captivity. It is amazing how not once was God mentioned in the whole of this book but the Jews had to fast and pray until their captivity was turned.
God had used Mordecai and Esther to bring relief to the Jews and salvation to the gentiles. This story of Esther and Mordecai is quite similar to the story of Joseph.</description>

      <description>EST 3:13 A decree by Haman to wipe out the entire Jewish race in a day lead to a celebration of a feast years later

EST 3:9 Evil people don&amp;rsquo;t spend money on themselves and their families. They spend it on evil things. Imagine Haman would rather pay 10000 talents of silver for evil. What a Jezebel of a man to use the King&amp;rsquo;s authority for evil.</description>

      <description>EST 2:15 Esther was humble. She listened to instructions both from Mordecai and Hegai, the king&amp;rsquo;s Eunuch.
Your level of success is determined by your level of obeying simple instructions.
