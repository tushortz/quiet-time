      <description>2CO 4:4 Solomon prayed for an understanding mind and a hearing (obedient heart). Understanding is really important in administer justice as the King and representatives of God.
I as a Christian represent the Lord Jesus and need understanding to obey the words of God. Unless God opens my mind, I may never understand many things that I have been taught. Since my mind needs to be renewed by the word of God, it becomes easier when I pray for God to give me an understanding mind and an obedient heart.</description>

      <description>2CO 3:14 the veil of unbelief is removed when we are in Christ
Related verses: 2 CORINTHIANS 3:14. See notes
2CO 3:14 People cannot understand the truth let alone believe it because their minds had been blinded by a veil caused by Satan. The veil can only be removed when we believe in Jesus.
This is why evangelists and preachers are needed
