      <description>1TI 2:15 The message version of this verse best explains it.
I have been wondering what apostle Paul was saying but i now I know that after Eve fell from transgression, she also got us the opportunity to be saved through childbearing which happened because a woman also gave birth to a saviour. Although the means of redemption has been provided, everyone still has the responsibility to work out their salvation through faith, love and holiness.</description>
