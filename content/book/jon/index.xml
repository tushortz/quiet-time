      <description>JON 4:11 Jonah did not perform miracles but there unbelieving Nations of Nineveh relented at the preaching of Nineveh.
The people of Israel saw Jesus perform many mighty miracles but did not repent. Jonah was a mere prophet. Jesus is the son of God.
Inspite of these, they did not repent so their judgement will be more severe

      <description>JON 1:6 It is amazing that it was the unbeliever captain that went to tell Jonah to stay awake and call on his God. Many times, we neglect our duty as Christians and it takes the unbelievers to awake us from our slumber.
The unbelievers even though they don?t believe in God, they can tell from your actions if you are truly a Christian because they expect a certain standard from you and if you are short of it, why will they believe in your God.</description>
