      <description>GAL 1:8 the prophet lied to the man of God than an angel had appeared to him to I form the man if God to go back and eat (thus contradicting the instructions that God gave the man of God).
no angel or man should be able to make me disobey the clear words given to me by God.
this was the same error that Adam and Eve committed after God has given a clear instruction.</description>

      <description>GAL 5:22 The woman personified as wisdom is the Holy Spirit. The spirit of counsel, wisdom, understanding, power, knowledge as mentioned in Isaiah.
wisdom (The Holy Spirit) can provide everything I need. this wisdom personified as a woman was given to Jesus in full measure as seen in Isaiah 11:2.
the fruit of wisdom is better than silver or gold. the fruits of wisdom is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness and faithfulness.</description>
