        <p>
            EXO 25:9 God was specific about the design. God is always specific in his word and that&rsquo;s why we are to fully obey him by paying attention to his word. Partial obedience is still disobedience.
Related verses: Sh&rsquo;mot (Exo) 25:9. See notes
EXO 25:8 THEY will make for GOD a sanctuary where he will dwell. Just as we are to offer our body a living sacrifice and it is a temple of the Holy Ghost but it needs to be according to God&rsquo;s word and specification

            EXO 24:12 God gave Moses the task to teach what has been written by God.
In the New Testament, we would deem him a great Apostle :), Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher.
Moses was a Priest and Prophet. He operated in 6 different offices

EXO 24:1 The 70 elders of Israel were the 70 descendants of Jacob who came with him or was already in Egypt.

        <p>
            EXO 23:29 God is also considerate of nature irrespective of his spiritual capabilities. Strategic planning is involved here as driving out the Canaanites, Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites, Amorites etc would cause the multiplication of wild animals.
These group of people are also needed to play their role so that the Israelites would in turn enjoy the fruit of their (not Israeli&rsquo;s) labour.

EXO 23:25 He and I signifying there are two entities involved in this speech.

        <p>
            EXO 13:17 God would not take the Israelites through shortcuts because they were not able to prove their preparation for warfare otherwise they would return back to Egypt, the land of son and bondage. Instead he take them through roundabouts, even though it was long, it was to prepare them carefully for the future and the promises ahead.
They had to be trained and tested so that they can be purified and fit for the promise land
