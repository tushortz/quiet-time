            EXO 5:1 Jesus fed them until they were satisfied. Everyone ate and the disciples had full baskets left for themselves.
When we follow Jesus he provides for our needs. He is our great shepherd so we will not lack any good thing.

        <p>
            EXO 16:33 The manna ceased but the law lasted forever. Man cannot live forever by eating bread or manna but man will have everlasting life if he abides by the word of God.
both manna and the commandments were given by God yet one was more important than the other.
The commandments lasted generations but the manna didn&rsquo;t even though both were provided by God. it goes to show that the spiritual is greater than the natural.

            EXO 22:28 He cursed the king and the punishment that David saw fit was death. I must be careful not to curse God or even the leader he has placed above me even in my thoughts because nothing is secret in this world. it&rsquo;s only a matter of time

            EXO 40:38 The cloud and the fire were visible manifestations of the presence of God.
They waited when God&rsquo;s presence was present and moved only when God&rsquo;s presence also moved. God was leading his people. The Holy spirit symbolises the cloud and the fire.

        <p>
            EXO 34:29 The reason his skin glowed was because he had been with God for forty days and forty night. The presence of God had permeated him so much that he became a different person.
That was the glory of God. the same happened when Peter, James and John saw Jesus glory on the mount of transfiguration when his face and cloth shone brighter than the sun

            EXO 32:11 Moses understood the heart of God. I don&rsquo;t think God really wanted to destroy them. that would have been the last resort because my God is full of mercy and compassion.
Moses reversed the word. Whereas God had initially said to Moses, YOUR PEOPLE, Moses now interceded telling God that this is YOUR PEOPLE whom you brought out of Egypt
