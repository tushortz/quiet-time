        <p>
            JER 19:5 The valley of Ben Hinnom was used to burn innocent children as sacrifices to Baal. God told Abraham to sacrifice his son as well on one of the mountains of Moriah long ago.
I think it wouldn&rsquo;t have been more difficult for Abraham if he had many children but because it was the only son of his old age, it was more difficult to do

            JER 45:5 God was going to destroy Jerusalem soon through Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and God was saving Baruch the stress of acquiring things that would soon be destroyed.
Because Baruch had been a faithful friend and scribe for Jeremiah, God was repaying him his good deeds by sparing his life.
It pays to be good.

God is righteous and if he would not forgive, then it was just of him

        <p>
            JER 22:10 This is tough punishment due to repetitive disobedience and an unwillingness to repent because of the pleasures that serving idols give.
Anyone that looks for prosperity at the expense of God is bound to be in darkness.

            JER 3:15 The shepherds are the priests whose role is to teach the people the ways of God because Israel and Judah had backslidden to the point where the covenant curses began to operate in the nation.
