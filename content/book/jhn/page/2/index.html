            JHN 21:24 The author of this gospel, John was born in 6AD making him 11 years younger than Jesus. He was 19 when Jesus began his ministry.
Related verses: JOHN 21:24. See notes
JHN 21:11 They had toiled al night to catch a single fish but at one command from Jesus and obedience, they caught more than they were able to carry.
It was until Jesus appeared and spoke that miracles happened.

        <p>
            JHN 9:14 The sabbath was a day of rest not a day of burdens. A day of freedom not a day of religious exercise.
Jesus freed the man on sabbath as much as he did miracles most of the time on the sabbath.
Jesus himself is our sabbath.
?Come to me all that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest?

That?s why they wanted to stone him because they considered it blasphemy.

            JHN 7:39 The people were saved but hadn&rsquo;t yet received the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was then poured out on the day of Pentecost after Jesus had been raised to honour at the right hand of the father.

        <p>
            JHN 13:18 I believe this Psalm was written when he fled from his son Absalom. His trusted friend and counsellor &ldquo;Ahithophel&rdquo; had connived with Absalom in his rebellion. Ahithophel&rsquo;s motive may have been because David slept with his grand daughter &ldquo;BathSheba&rdquo; and had his son&rsquo;s son-in-law Uriah killed in battle.
In those days, Ahithophel&rsquo;s counsel was such that it was likened to when one inquired at the oracles of God (2 Samuel 16:23).
