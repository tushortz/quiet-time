            1SA 29:11 God rescued David from a dilemma. whether he fought against Israel or against the Philistines would have been unhelpful. I believe he would have turned against the Philistines but nevertheless, the other Philistine commanders did not trust David.
it was also the best decision to go back and not fight against Israel because they went back home to find that the Amalekite had gone on a raid and taken their family captive
