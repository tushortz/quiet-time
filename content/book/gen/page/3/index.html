            GEN 45:11 Joseph was 39 years at this time
Related verses: GENESIS 45:11. See notes
GEN 45:8 Recognised that it was God&rsquo;s will and not of his brothers to sell him into slavery.
God had a better plan. Previously God had told Abraham about what was gonna happen in the future that Israelites would be slaves in Egypt. This is how God&rsquo;s plan would be fulfilled.

        <p>
            GEN 46:4 Faith Even though Jacob knew his families were going to suffer in Egypt for 400+ years, he still obeyed God. Even though he didn&rsquo;t live to witness those years of suffering nor did he get the inheritance in his lifetime, he still proceeded into Egypt with his family.
Sometimes, it is God&rsquo;s will that we go through a very difficult time in our life. God has his plan and his reward but are we willing to trust him even though we don&rsquo;t see the big picture or do we want to do it our own way and bear the consequences.

        <p>
            GEN 44:33 Repentance What a transformation. The Judah that was behind selling Joseph as a slave in times past was now willing to be in place of Benjamin as a servant of Joseph. Great sign of repentance. The brothers of Joseph had come to realise that they acted foolishly are now regretting their past actions
When you repent, it shows in your actions and words
