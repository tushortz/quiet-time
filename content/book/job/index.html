            JOB 2:7 The threshing wheel separates the chaff from the wheat by subjecting the grain to pressure when it is treaded on by both the wheels and the cow threshing the grain.
Satan petitioned God to have Job sifted like wheat but Job&rsquo;s faith did not fail. Satan demanded that Peter would be tested as well but his faith did not fail even when he denied Jesus and went back to fishing.

JOB 1:1 the reason is because Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was not of this world. it was God&rsquo;s wisdom.

            JOB 42:12 Job was the greatest of all the men in the East yet God blessed him even more by doubling it
Related verses: Job 42:12. See notes
JOB 42:8 Job&rsquo;s friend Eliphaz wasn&rsquo;t present when God spoke to Job. I believe none of Job&rsquo;s other friends were around because God told Eliphaz to go to Job with 7 bulls and 7 rams so he could act as priest on their behalf

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 36:14 Some of the cult prostitutes were homosexuals. it was seen as a fertility rite and oh my goodness, what a terrible atrocity.
I believe this is the same practice in Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim.
I believe they indulged in idol worship which permitted them to indulge in homosexuality and that became the culture of the city.
unfortunately this is where all false religion ends up people in.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 23:10 Job is confident he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to deserve anything he was facing due to the understanding of his time that blessings is directly proportional to godliness (which is actually true in the long run).
Job is now experienced to know that in the short run that isn&rsquo;t necessarily always true yet his friends accuse him of wickedness.
Job thinks when God has tried him, he will be found innocent of the punishment he&rsquo;s facing due to his sin.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 22:30 lol it&rsquo;s actually funny that this was exactly what happened to Eliphaz. God told Job to pray for his three friends after they had misrepresented God and said false statements about Job&rsquo;s integrity
Related verses: Job 22:30. See notes
JOB 22:5 False accusations. we can&rsquo;t judge by circumstances the Integrity of a person.
in ancient times blessings is directly associated with righteous and the devil tries to break this bond by imploring God to do that in the life of Job.
