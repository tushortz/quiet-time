            JOB 27:6 What a man. There would be many questions running in Job&rsquo;s minds coupled with his friend&rsquo;s accusations, he still held fast to his integrity

        <p>
            JOB 19:13 Many people deserted Job in his affliction. It is easy to say you suffered this because you have sinned but that&rsquo;s not always true. Job is so confident that he hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong that he is willing to go to court with God but needs a lawyer. But what lawyer can even stand before the almighty God.
Job accused God of doing evil to him. Although God didn&rsquo;t do any of these.

        <p>
            JOB 5:17 If God reproves you, it means you have a good relationship with him. Like a father does to his own dear son

JOB 5:12 You cannot enjoy the work of your hands if you attained them using evil schemes

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">JOB 3</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            JOB 3:25 Job always sacrificed animals for his children because he thought they might have cursed God in their heart but unfortunately, they died anyway.
One thing to notice is that Satan is trying to break the link between righteousness and blessings, so that he would expose the righteous man for the sinner he is (by cursing God) - NASB study Bible
It is also great to know that God himself didn&rsquo;t kill any of Job&rsquo;s children nor did he inflict him with sores or ruin his business.
