      <description>PSA 91:1 The proof that I love Jesus is obeying is commandments. The effect of that is his presence because Jesus said he and his father will come to live with me.
I already have the Holy spirit living in me but for Jesus and God to come as well that&amp;rsquo;s another level.
Jesus already promised he&amp;rsquo;s with me through the ages. I prepare God a secret place through obedience to his words.</description>

You must know God before you can be strong in the Lord.
Example, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the country&amp;rsquo;s system e.g. Free education till certain level in some countries, you would be at loss.</description>
